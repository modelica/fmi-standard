=== Description Schema [[scheduled-execution-schema]]

The common XML elements and attributes are defined in <<modelDescription.xml,FMI Description Schema>>.
Additional elements and attributes are defined subsequently.
If the FMU implements the Scheduled Execution interface type, the element `<ScheduledExecution>` must be present.
It is defined as:

.ScheduledExecution element.

The element `<ScheduledExecution>` does not have any attributes other than defined as <<common-capability-flags, common attributes>>.

==== Example XML Description File

The simulation algorithm collects the information about the number and properties of <<Clock,`Clocks`>> supported by the FMU via analyzing the <<modelDescription.xml>>.
For every <<inputClock>> the simulation algorithm identifies a model partition of the FMU.
The properties <<intervalDecimal>> (or <<intervalCounter>>) and <<priority>> are defined based on the <<inputClock,input clocks'>> <<intervalDecimal>> (or <<intervalCounter>>) and <<priority>> defined in the <<modelDescription.xml>>.
The simulation algorithm can read from the <<modelDescription.xml>> that <<outputClock>> `OutClock` may tick triggered by <<inputClock>> `10msClock` and that <<inputClock>> `AperiodicClock` is triggered by `OutClock`.
