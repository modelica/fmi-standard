=== Code Example

In the following example, the usage of the `fmi3XXX` functions is sketched in order to clarify the typical calling sequence of the functions in a simulation environment.
Furthermore, it is assumed that one FMU is directly integrated in a simulation environment.
If the FMU would be used inside another model, additional code is needed, especially initialization and event iteration has to be adapted.
