|Term
|Description

|differential algebraic equation
|A differential equation that contains both differential and algebraic equations. Abbreviated as DAE.
DAEs are more general than ODEs and are used to describe systems with constraints.


|electronic control unit
|A microprocessor that is used to control a technical system. Commonly abbreviated as ECU.
ECUs are widely used in automotive and other engineering applications for real-time control.

|event
|An instantaneous occurrence at a specific time or when a condition is met, potentially causing discrete state changes.

|exporter
|A program that creates an FMU.

|feedthrough
|Feedthrough indicates that an output variable's value depends directly on an input variable's value.

|importer
|The tool that imports, loads, and executes one or more FMUs.
The importer is responsible for instantiating FMU instances and managing their execution.
This includes simulation tools, optimizers, and other software that processes FMUs.

|integration algorithm
|The numerical algorithm to solve differential equations.

|integrator
|A software component which implements an integration algorithm.

|interface
|An abstraction of a software component that describes its behavior without dealing with the internal implementation.
Software components communicate with each other via interfaces.

|mock-up
|A full-sized structural, but not necessarily functional model built accurately to scale, used chiefly for study, testing, or display.
In the context of computer aided design (CAD), a digital mock-up (DMU) means a computer-based representation of the product geometry with its parts, usually in 3-D, for all kinds of geometrical and mechanical analyses.

|model
|A model is a mathematical or logical representation of a system of entities, phenomena, or processes.
Basically a model is a simplified abstract view of the complex reality.
It can be used to compute its expected behavior under specified conditions.

|ordinary differential equation
|A differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable (typically time) and the derivatives of those functions.
Abbreviated as ODE.

|parameter
|A quantity within a model which remains constant during simulation or may change at event instances.
Examples are a mass, stiffness, etc.

|[[reverse-DNS]]reverse domain name notation
|A naming convention based on registered domain names, with the order of the components reversed for grouping purposes.

|simulation
|Compute the behavior of one or several models under specified conditions.

|simulation tool
|Software application used to develop, configure, and/or execute simulation models. Typically includes model editing, solvers, execution control, and post-processing.

|simulator
|A software application that can include one or more simulation tools.

|solver
|Software component which includes algorithms to solve models, for example, integration algorithms and event handling methods.

|state
|The continuous states of a model are all variables that appear differentiated in the model and are independent from each other.
The discrete-time states of a model are time-discrete variables that have two values in a model: The value of the variable from the previous event instant, and the value of the variable at the actual event instant.

|[[transmission-line-modeling,Transmission Line Modeling]]transmission line modeling
|A mathematical method which uses physically motivated time delays to decouple an equation system into independent parts during a specified time frame without compromising numerical stability.
Also known as the _bi-lateral delay line_ method. For more details see <<FBH18>>.

|user interface
|The part of a simulator that gives the user control over the simulation and allows watching results.
