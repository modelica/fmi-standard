|Description

|<<modelIdentifier>>
|Short class name according to C syntax, for example, `A_B_C`.
Used as prefix for FMI functions if the functions are provided in C source code or in static libraries, but not if the functions are provided by a DLL/SharedObject.
<<modelIdentifier>> is also used as name of the static library or DLL/SharedObject.
See also <<header-files-and-naming-of-functions>>.

|`needsCompletedIntegratorStep`
|If `true`, the function <<fmi3CompletedIntegratorStep>> must be called after every completed integrator step.
If `false` (the default) and the function is called anyway, it has no effect.
