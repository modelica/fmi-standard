=== Code Example [[example-scheduled-execution]]

The FMU ThreeInputClocks sketches the usage of the FMI functions.
The example is given in a mix of pseudo-code and C, in order to keep it small and understandable.
We consider one FMU with three model partitions.
Two model partitions associated to two <<periodic-clock,periodic Clocks>> `10msClock` and `50msClock` (periods 10 ms and 50 ms) and one aperiodic <<countdown, `countdown clock`>> `AperiodicClock`.

During the execution of the model partition of <<Clock>> `10msClock` the FMU sets the <<interval>> for <<countdown, `countdown clock`>> `AperiodicClock` and calls <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> to invoke the execution of the corresponding model partition.

The function calls <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> are executed in the context of preemptable tasks whose priorities are derived from the respective <<Clock>> configurations of the FMU.
In this example the execution of the task of <<countdown, `countdown clock`>> `AperiodicClock` is waiting for the task of <<Clock>> `10msClock` to finish.
Likewise the task of `AperiodicClock` is suspended when the task of higher priority is scheduled again.

The example also depicts how a task associated to an even lower prior <<Clock>> `50msClock` is delayed several times by tasks of higher priority.
Note that the point of time when the task was scheduled is the `activationTime` of <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> (...Activate...(`clock`, `activationTime`)).

==== Simulation Algorithm Implementation

To enable the computation of a Scheduled Execution FMU a simulation algorithm has to provide a task scheduler.
Depending on the particular configuration the simulation algorithm sets up tasks for every <<inputClock>>.
When executed each task calls <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> for its respective <<Clock>>.
The `activationTime` is provided by the simulation algorithm.
Periodic tasks can be scheduled on initialization of the simulation application.
Aperiodic tasks are scheduled explicitly during the execution.

The FMU requests to schedule the model partition of `AperiodicClock`.
It calls <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> to enable the importer to check whether the FMU has defined a new interval for `AperiodicClock`.
Evaluating the return values <<qualifier>> and <<interval>> of <<fmi3GetInterval>> the simulation algorithms determines if the respective task has to be scheduled and which delay has to be applied.

==== FMU Implementation

The FMU implements <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> dispatching for every <<inputClock>> so the code might look like this:

In the context of the task being executed every 10 ms, the FMU initiates the scheduling of a task by setting a new interval to <<countdown, `countdown Clock`>> `AperiodicClock` and evoking <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>>.

In <<fmi3GetIntervalDecimal>> the Clock's interval qualifier is reset to <<fmi3GetIntervalDecimal, `fmi3IntervalUnchanged`>>.
To ensure consistency the FMU may need to prevent preemption.
In this example it is actually not needed since CallbackIntermediateUpdate is only called from one model partition.

If <<fmi3GetClock>> is called for a certain <<outputClock>> the <<outputClock>> is reset.
As for <<fmi3GetIntervalDecimal>> it may be necessary for the FMU to ensure that the code is not preempted.
Here it is just as well not needed for the same reason.
