=== Code Example [[example-scheduled-execution]]

The FMU ThreeInputClocks sketches the usage of the FMI functions.
The example is given in a mix of pseudo-code and C, in order to keep it small and understandable.
We consider one FMU with three model partitions.
Two model partitions associated to two periodic <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> 10msClock and 50msClock (<<clock>> periods 10 ms and 50 ms) and one aperiodic <<inputClock>> AperiodicClock.

During the execution of the model partition of <<inputClock>> 10msClock the <<outputClock>> OutClock may tick and invoke the execution of model partition of aperiodic <<inputClock>> AperiodicClock.

The function calls <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> are executed in the context of preemptable tasks whose priorities are derived from the respective <<inputClock>> configurations of the FMU.
In this example the execution of the task of <<inputClock>> AperiodicClock is waiting for the task of <<inputClock>> 10msClock to finish.
Likewise the task of AperiodicClock is suspended when the task of higher priority is scheduled again.

The example also depicts how a task associated to an even lower prior <<inputClock>> 50msClock is delayed several times by tasks of higher priority.
Note that the point of time when the task was scheduled is the `activationTime` of <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> (...Activate...(`input clock`, `activationTime`)).

==== Simulation Algorithm Implementation

To enable the computation of a Scheduled Execution FMU a simulation algorithm has to provide a task scheduler.
Depending on the particular configuration the simulation algorithm sets up tasks for every <<inputClock>>.
When executed each task calls <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> for its respective <<inputClock>>.
The `activationTime` is provided by the simulation algorithm.
Periodic tasks can be scheduled on initialization of the simulation application.
Aperiodic tasks are scheduled explicitly during the execution.

[source, C]
----
Task10ms.Execute()
{
   // Set inputs with valueReference 0 and 1 associated to clockIndex 5
   fmi3SetFloat64(s, {0,1}, &AIn);
   // call for 10msClock tick (clockIndex 5)
   fmi3ActivateModelPartition(s, 5, 0, Task10ms.ActivationTime);
   // Get output with valueReference 2 associated to clockIndex 0
   fmi3GetFloat64(s, {2}, &AOut);
};
----

As specified in the XML file, <<inputClock>> AperiodicClock is triggered by <<outputClock>> OutClock thus the simulation algorithm ensures the task associated to AperiodicClock is scheduled when <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> is called by the FMU and OutClock has ticked.

[source, C]
----
void CallbackIntermediateUpdate(..., fmi3Boolean clocksTicked, ...)
{
   fmi3ValueReference outputClockReferences = {7};
   fmi3Boolean[] clocksActivationState = {fmi3ClockInactive};
   if (clocksTicked)
   {
      // ask FMU if output clock has ticked
      fmi3GetClocks(... outputClockReferences, &clocksActivationState, ...);
   }
   if (clocksActivationState[0])
   {
      // schedule task for AperiodicClock
      Scheduler->ScheduleTask(TaskAperiodic);
   }
}
----

==== FMU Implementation

The FMU implements <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> dispatching for every <<inputClock>> so the code might look like this:

[source, C]
----
fmi3Status fmi3ActivateModelPartition(fmi3Instance *instance,
   fmi3ValueReference clockReference, fmi3Float64 activationTime)
{
   switch (clockReference)
   {
      case 5:
         // Input clock 10msClock
         activateModelPartition10ms(instance, activationTime);
      case 6:
         // Input clock AperiodicClock
         activateModelPartitionAperiodic(instance, activationTime);
      case 8:
         // Input clock AperiodicClock
         activateModelPartition50ms(instance, activationTime);
      ...
   }
}
----

In the context of the task being executed every 10 ms, the FMU lets <<outputClock>> OutClock tick and calls <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>>.

[source, C]
----
void activateModelPartition10ms(fmi3Instance *instance, ...)
{
   ...
   if (...)
   {
      // outputClock ticks
      fmi3SetClock({7});
      // inform simulation algorithm that output clock has ticked
      fmi3Boolean clocksTicked = fmi3True;
      instance->fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate(..., clocksTicked, ...);
   }
   ...
}
----

If <<fmi3GetClock>> is called for a certain <<outputClock>> the <<outputClock>> is reset.

[source, C]
----
fmi3Status fmi3GetClock(..., fmi3ValueReference outputClockReferences,
   fmi3Clock *clocksActivationState, ...)
{
   if (outputClockReferences[0] == 7)
   {
      clocksActivationState[0] = outClockActivationState;
      outClockActivationState = fmi3ClockInactive;
   }
}
