=== Code Example [[example-scheduled-execution]]

The FMU ThreeInputClocks sketches the usage of the FMI functions.
The example is given in a mix of pseudo-code and C, in order to keep it small and understandable.
We consider one FMU with three model partitions.
Two model partitions associated to two periodic <<clock,`clocks`>> 10msClock and 50msClock (periods 10 ms and 50 ms) and one aperiodic <<countdown, `countdown clock`>> AperiodicClock.

During the execution of the model partition of <<clock>> 10msClock the FMU sets the <<interval>> for <<countdown, `countdown clock`>> AperiodicClock and calls <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> to invoke the execution of the coresponding model partition.

The function calls <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> are executed in the context of preemptable tasks whose priorities are derived from the respective <<clock>> configurations of the FMU.
In this example the execution of the task of <<countdown, `countdown clock`>> AperiodicClock is waiting for the task of <<clock>> 10msClock to finish.
Likewise the task of AperiodicClock is suspended when the task of higher priority is scheduled again.

The example also depicts how a task associated to an even lower prior <<clock>> 50msClock is delayed several times by tasks of higher priority.
Note that the point of time when the task was scheduled is the `activationTime` of <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> (...Activate...(`clock`, `activationTime`)).

==== Simulation Algorithm Implementation

To enable the computation of a Scheduled Execution FMU a simulation algorithm has to provide a task scheduler.
Depending on the particular configuration the simulation algorithm sets up tasks for every <<clock>> of <<causality, `causality == input`>>.
When executed each task calls <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> for its respective <<clock>>.
The `activationTime` is provided by the simulation algorithm.
Periodic tasks can be scheduled on initialization of the simulation application.
Aperiodic tasks are scheduled explicitly during the execution.

[source, C]
----
Task10ms.Execute()
{
   // Set inputs with valueReference 0 and 1 associated to clockIndex 5
   fmi3SetFloat64(s, {0,1}, &AIn);
   // call for 10msClock tick (clockIndex 5)
   fmi3ActivateModelPartition(s, 5, 0, Task10ms.ActivationTime);
   // Get output with valueReference 2 associated to clockIndex 0
   fmi3GetFloat64(s, {2}, &AOut);
};
----

The FMU requests to schedule the model partition of AperiodicClock.
It calls <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> to enable the importer to check whether the FMU has defined a new interval for AperiodicClock.
Evaluating the return values <<qualifier>> and <<interval>> of <<fmi3GetInterval>> the simulation algorithms determines if the respective task has to be scheduled and which delay has to be applied.

[source, C]
----
void CallbackIntermediateUpdate(...)
{
   fmi3ValueReference aperiodicClockReferences = {6};
   fmi3GetIntervalDecimal(... aperiodicClockReferences, ... &interval, &qualifier, ...);
   if (qualifier[0] == fmi3NewInterval)
   {
      // schedule task for AperiodicClock with a delay
      Scheduler->ScheduleTask(TaskAperiodic, interval[0]);
   }
}
----

==== FMU Implementation

The FMU implements <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> dispatching for every <<clock>> of <<causality, `causality == input`>> so the code might look like this:

[source, C]
----
fmi3Status fmi3ActivateModelPartition(fmi3Instance *instance,
   fmi3ValueReference clockReference, fmi3Float64 activationTime)
{
   switch (clockReference)
   {
      case 5:
         // Input clock 10msClock
         activateModelPartition10ms(instance, activationTime);
      case 6:
         // Input clock AperiodicClock
         activateModelPartitionAperiodic(instance, activationTime);
      case 8:
         // Input clock AperiodicClock
         activateModelPartition50ms(instance, activationTime);
      ...
   }
}
----

In the context of the task being executed every 10 ms, the FMU initiates the scheduling of a task by setting a new interval to <<countdown, `countdown clock`>> AperiodicClock and evoking <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>>.

TODO: Clarify example.

[source, C]
----
void activateModelPartition10ms(fmi3Instance *instance, ...)
{
   ...
   if (...)
   {
      // outputClock ticks
      fmi3SetClock({7});
      // inform simulation algorithm that output clock has ticked
      fmi3Boolean clocksTicked = fmi3True;
      instance->fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate(..., clocksTicked, ...);
   }
   ...
}
----

If <<fmi3GetClock>> is called for a certain <<outputClock>> the <<outputClock>> is reset.

[source, C]
----
fmi3Status fmi3GetClock(..., fmi3ValueReference outputClockReferences,
   fmi3Clock *clocksActivationState, ...)
{
   if (outputClockReferences[0] == 7)
   {
      clocksActivationState[0] = outClockActivationState;
      outClockActivationState = fmi3ClockInactive;
   }
}
