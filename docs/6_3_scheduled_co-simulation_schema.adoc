=== Description Schema [[scheduled-co-simulation-schema]]

The simulation master collects the information about the number and properties of <<clock,`clocks`>> supported by the FMU via analyzing the `modelDescription.xml` as defined in section 2.2. and 4.3.

Each <<clock>> that ticks outside of the FMU is activated for an FMU based on its <<clockReference>>.
There is a direct one-to-one relation for a <<clock>> and a model partition.

If <<clock,`clocks`>> are defined and the flag `providesScheduledCoSimulation = true`, the Co-Simulation master can set the fmuType to `fmi3ScheduledCoSimulation`.
If no <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> are defined the flag `providesScheduledCoSimulation` shall not be set to `true`.

==== Example XML Description File

The example below is the same one as shown in section [TBD] for a `fmi3ClockedCoSimulation` FMU.
