=== Mathematical Description [[math-scheduled-co-simulation]]

The Scheduled Co-Simulation interface has a different timing concept compared to both Co-Simulation interfaces.
This is required to cover <<clock>> ticks for aperiodic <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> which may tick at time instances that are not predictable in advance for the simulation master.
Typically, hardware I/O or virtual ECU software events belong to this category.

A Co-Simulation master's call for computing a model partition will compute the results of the model partition defined by an <<inputClock>> for the current <<clock>> tick time latexmath:[t_i].

The result values will be computed for the current <<clock>> tick time (activation time) latexmath:[t_i] from the assigned <<inputClock>> (which is known to the Co-Simulation master).
Refer to the <<clock>> time progress definition (<<clock-types-for-evaluation-of-clocked-model-partitions>>) for periodic <<clock,`clocks`>>.

If required, the FMU can internally derive the <<clock>> interval latexmath:[\Delta T_i] based on the last <<clock>> tick time latexmath:[t_{i-1}] i.e. last activation time for this model partition.

A model partition can only be activated once per activation time point latexmath:[t_i].

Model partitions that are associated to <<outputClock,`output clocks`>> will accordingly provide the result values of the model partition's variables for the current <<outputClock>> tick time latexmath:[t_i] of the active <<outputClock>>.
The activation of such a <<outputClock>> is not directly controlled by the Co-Simulation master but internally by the FMU.
