== Introduction

=== Intend of this Document

Automotive CAN, LIN, FlexRay, CAN FD and CAN XL are network technologies that have been applied successfully over many years by all automotive OEMs world wide.
Virtualizing electronic control units (ECUs) and then simulating multiple such vECUs requires connecting them using a virtual version of these network technologies.
Reusing standard network topology description formats, such as DBC, LDF, Fibex and ARXML, is required for efficiency and testing reasons alike.
Files in these formats exist in validated form as part of the engineering process, tooling exists and these standards evolve to support new use cases.

This document describes how to use standard description formats for automotive network topologies on top of the FMI 3.0 standard.
vECUs following this standard can then easily be connected in importing tools because the <<NetworkDescriptionFile,network description files>> declare which signals have what properties and belong to what frame/PDU in which of the potentially multiple networks connected to each vECU.
The importer does not need to know about the special network semantics of certain variables of an FMU; it simply forwards variable values according to the FMI standard (<<multiOutput,with one exception noted at the end of the document>>).

FMUs can extract frame and signal properties from the <<NetworkDescriptionFile,network description files>> and that allows all exporters and importers to have the same understanding and interpretation of the FMU signals.
Such signal properties are, for example: signal scaling, frame/PDU timing and trigger conditions, packaging of signals in frames and unit definitions.
This document does not address potential open points of these description formats, it is assumed that such ambiguities will be handled elsewhere (e.g. message timing in the DBC format).
This document does not address IP protection or copyright issues.
These are technical and legal issues that need attention from standardization bodies of the referenced description formats, tool vendors and end users.

=== Basic Aspects of this Layered Standard

This standard supports two abstraction layers for network stacks:

Signal abstraction layer (also "high cut"):: physical signals as exchanged between the application software (ASW) and the basic software (BSW), in AUTOSAR this would be the Virtual Function Bus, and

Frame abstraction layer (also "low cut"):: binary signal or signals representing one or more network frames as exchanged through the micro-controller abstraction layer (MCAL) between BSW and the hardware driver.

Standardized <<NetworkDescriptionFile,network description files>> shipped with each FMU describe properties of signals and frames, such as signal units, frame composition and trigger conditions.
These <<NetworkDescriptionFile,network description files>> are placed into the `/extra/org.modelica.fmi.networks4FMI` folder.

Both abstraction layers are nearly equivalent and can be translated into one another using the <<NetworkDescriptionFile,network description files>>.
Depending on the export tool, one of the abstraction layers is more "natural" to the FMU, while the other might have to be emulated with additional internal effort.
Importers on the other hand rarely require both abstraction layers for system level compositions, because the engineering task defines the level of abstraction for the network communication.
FMUs may choose to only support one abstraction layer providing only the corresponding variables.
However, for versatility, having FMU capable of communicating on both abstraction layers is more convenient for users.

_[FMUs providing both abstraction layers can deduce from the fmi3Set() and fmi3Get() calls they receive, which abstraction layer the importer is using.]_

Since network communication is not continuous but time discrete, FMI 3.0 clocks are used to indicate when signals and/or frames are sent.
All signal and frame variables are clocked variables.

FMI 3.0 terminal definitions in the `terminalsAndIcons.xml` for each level of grouping (networks, frames and PDUs) allow system composition tools without knowledge of the network description format to semantically group signals.
To uniquely map between the FMU variables and the network variables, FMU variable names are structured, e.g. `BusName::FrameName::PDUName::SignalName`.

If an FMU specifies nodes that are both senders and receivers of a frame, the receiver role will be removed from the FMU interface to allow the signals to have a unique role as output and the reading of such outputs must be handled internally to the FMU.
_[The FMI standard requires a variable to be either input or output.]_

== Details

=== Network Description Files [[NetworkDescriptionFile,network description file]]

FMI 3.0 introduces an `/extra` folder in its `zip` structure.
The <<NetworkDescriptionFile,network description files>> will be placed under the reverse domain name controlled by the MAP FMI: `/extra/org.modelica.fmi.networks4FMI`.
DBC, LDF, Fibex and ARXML files are allowed.
The root name of the <<NetworkDescriptionFile>> shall be used as network identifier in the bus terminal type and are case sensitive, e.g. `Powertrain.dbc`.

Multiple files can be specified, each one defining one network used by the FMU.
This standard does not support composing one network from multiple <<NetworkDescriptionFile,network description files>>, even if using internal include mechanisms, it rather enforces the rule: one network - one file.

It is recommended to use ARXML over DBC files for CAN whenever possible, because the DBC standard lacks some key frame/PDU properties that were added only later using non-standard extensions with different dialects in use.

=== Variables

This section explains the different variable types used to carry network traffic through FMI input and output variables.

==== Signal Variables

To define the signal abstraction layer (or "high cut"), signal variables are defined.

A signal variable carries the physical value of a network signal normally packaged inside a PDU or frame.
The unit definition of the variable must match the one defined in the <<NetworkDescriptionFile>>.

Each network signal must be listed as <<TerminalMemberVariable>> of its corresponding <<PDUTerminal>>.

In case multiplexed signals are present in a frame/PDU: all signals are present, but only the active signal according to the multiplex switch signal contains a valid value, all inactive variables have undefined values _[those values could even be outside their specified min-max range without fault]_.

Generally, signal variables are optional, but they must either be all missing or all present to clearly indicate support for the signal abstraction layer.

==== Frame Variables [[FrameVariable]]

To define the frame abstraction layer (or "low cut"), frame variables are defined.

A frame variable is of type `fmi3Binary` and contains one or more binary frames, from and including `Start of Frame` until and including `End of Frame` and frame padding between frames.
Frames and inter-frame padding are build according to the network definitions.

There are two such frame variables per bus: an input and an output.
The names of these frame variables are defined as `BusName::FRAMES_in` and `BusName::FRAMES_out`, e.g. `Powertrain::FRAMES_in` and `Powertrain::FRAMES_out` (see <<Example>>).

Both frame variables must be listed as <<TerminalMemberVariable>> of its corresponding <<BUSTerminal>>.

Generally, frame variables are optional, but they must either both be missing or present to clearly indicate support for the frame abstraction layer.

==== Clock Variables [[ClockVariable]]

In order to use FMU input and output variables as transport layer for networks, aperiodic, triggered input and output clocks are used.
Such a clock is activated by the sender to indicate the transmission of the corresponding frame or frames.

Each frame `BusName::FrameName` has its own dedicated clock variable named `BusName::FrameName_CLOCK`, e.g. `POWERTRAIN::ecuState_CLOCK`, and must be listed as <<TerminalMemberVariable>> of its corresponding <<FrameTerminal>>.

All signal variables are clocked variables.
Signal variables belonging to frame `BusName::FrameName` are triggered by the clock `BusName::FrameName_CLOCK` and all these variables must share the same `causality`.

Each frame variable `BusName::FRAMES_in` and `BusName::FRAMES_out` have their own dedicated clock variable named `BusName::FRAMES_in_CLOCK` and `BusName::FRAMES_out_CLOCK`, e.g. `Powertrain::FRAMES_in_CLOCK` and `Powertrain::FRAMES_out_CLOCK`, respectively, must have the appropriate `causality`, and must be listed as <<TerminalMemberVariable>> of its corresponding <<BUSTerminal>>.

// what about dynamic PDUs? Do they need their own clocks as well?

=== Terminal Definitions

==== Bus Terminal [[BUSTerminal,bus terminal]]

Each network connected to the FMU must be described in `icons/terminalsAndIcons.xml` as a `<Terminal>` element of `<fmiTerminalsAndIcons><Terminals>` that wraps all <<FrameTerminal,frame terminals>>.
The attribute `name` of the `<Terminal>` must match the root name of its <<NetworkDescriptionFile>>
_[e.g. `Powertrain`, if the file is `/extra/org.modelica.fmi.layered_BUS/Powertrain.dbc`]_.

Attribute definitions::
 * `terminalKind` must be set to `bus`.
 * `matchingRule` must be set to `bus`.
 * `name` is the network name, e.g. `Powertrain`, see <<Example>> and constraints above.

Element definitions::
 * If frame variables (`BusName::FRAMES_in` and `BusName::FRAMES_out`) and their clocks (`BusName::FRAMES_in_CLOCK` and `BusName::FRAMES_out_CLOCK`) are exposed in the `modelDescription.xml`, they must be listed as `<TerminalMemberVariable>` elements here.
 These variables represent the frame abstraction layer ("low cut").
 * There must be no `<TerminalStreamMemberVariable>` element.
 * There must be one `<Terminal>` element per network frame described in the <<NetworkDescriptionFile>>.

Annotation element::
 * There must be an `<Annotation>` element defining which node or nodes (as comma-separated list without spaces) of the <<NetworkDescriptionFile>> are wrapped inside the FMU.
If the combination of nodes specified for this FMU turns a frame and its signals into both input and output because sending and receiving nodes are specified, only the sending (output) role will be defined in the FMU interface.
Receiving such frames must then be handled internally to the FMU.

==== Frame Terminal [[FrameTerminal,frame terminal]]

Each frame listed in the <<NetworkDescriptionFile>> must be an element of its corresponding <<BUSTerminal>>.

Attribute definitions::
 * `terminalKind` must be set to `frame`.
 * `matchingRule` must be set to `bus`.
 * `name` must match the frame name as defined in the <<NetworkDescriptionFile>> in `/extra/org.modelica.fmi.layered_BUS`.

Element definitions::
 * There must be no `<TerminalStreamMemberVariable>` element.
 * There must be one <<PDUTerminal>> element per PDU of this frame.
 * There must be one `<TerminalMemberVariable>` for the clock this frame is connected to.
   The name of this variable is composed as <<ClockVariable,`BusName::FrameName_CLOCK`>>, e.g. `Powertrain::tcuSensors_CLOCK`.

The <<TerminalMemberVariable>> must have the same causality as all variables referenced in the <<PDUTerminal,PDU Terminals>> included here.

==== PDU Terminal [[PDUTerminal,PDU terminal]]

Each PDU listed in the <<NetworkDescriptionFile>> must be an element of its corresponding <<FrameTerminal>>.

Attribute definitions::
 * `terminalKind` must be set to `pdu`.
 * `matchingRule` must be set to `bus`.
 * `name` must match a PDU name of the <<NetworkDescriptionFile>> in `/extra/org.modelica.fmi.layered_BUS`.
    For network types not natively referencing a "PDU", like CAN, a synthetic PDU with the same name as its frame is inserted.

Element definitions::
 * There must be no `<TerminalStreamMemberVariable>` element.
 * There must be no `<Terminal>` element.
 * There must be one `<TerminalMemberVariable>` per <<TerminalMemberVariable,signal>> of this PDU.

All <<TerminalMemberVariable,`TerminalMemberVariables`>> must have the same causality of either input or output.

==== Terminal Member Variable for Signals [[TerminalMemberVariable,Terminal Member Variable]]

<<PDUTerminal,PDU terminals>> list all the contained signals as `<TerminalMemberVariable>`.

Attribute definitions::
 * `variableName` refers to the input or output variable name of the FMU and to enforce uniqueness is built as follows: `BusName::FrameName::PDUName::SignalName`, e.g. `Powertrain::tcuSensors::tcuSensors::vCar`.
    These variables represent the signal abstraction layer ("high cut").
 * `memberName` is the `SignalName` as given in the <<NetworkDescriptionFile>>, e.g. `vCar`.
    This is redundant information but simplifies signal name extraction.
 * `variableKind` is `signal`.

=== Known Limitations of this Standard

This layered standard maps several network protocols onto co-simulation variables as transport layer simulating in many ways an ideal network.
Such an ideal network differs from physical networks in the following ways (and potentially others):

 * Network frame arbitration: frames are sent on the wire according to network-specific priority rules. +
   Here all frames are transmitted at the same time without delay.

 * Network congestion/bandwidth: too many network frames sent for the bandwidth of the network. +
   Here the network has infinite capacity.

 * Protocol functions of higher levels: i.e. CAN request for retransmit is a specific protocol function. +
   Here such specialties must be handled by the first layer inside the FMU.

 * Incoming buffer overflow: when an ECU receives more frames than its buffer can hold. +
   Here the FMU will receive all frames, regardless of buffer size.

 * Network transmission errors: electrical errors which cause failed frame transmission. +
   Here no such transmission errors can occur, unless explicitly added into the simulation.

 * [[multiOutput]]Network protocols allow frames to be sent from more than one node. +
   Here this is also possible, with output variables for frames (and their signals) that are sent by more than one FMU.
   This requires the importer to handle the case when multiple source FMUs are sending the same frame.
   Importers must know how to handle this, just like they must know how to handle flow variables according to Kirchhoff's law.
