=== Intermediate Variable Access [[intermediate-variable-access]]
:DOSTEP: fmi3DoStep()

An FMU shall be able to inform a co-simulation master that is able to provide intermediate output variables and/or receive intermediate input variables at any time, i.e. not only at the end of a current `{DOSTEP}` function call.
It shall be possible for the FMU to inform the master whether the internal solver is in a temporary state or if it has just completed an internal integration step.
If the internal solver is at a temporary state, intermediate output variables shall only be used for directly computing intermediate input variables.
If the internal integration step is completed, the master can forward intermediate outputs to interconnected simulation units.

===	Changes in modelDescription.xml 
New variable capability flag: `intermediateAccess`  = `true/false`.
