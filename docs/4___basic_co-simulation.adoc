== FMI for Basic Co-Simulation [[fmi-for-basic-co-simulation]]

// TODO: Go over this and move parts to the common cosim concepts section.

This chapter defines the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) for the coupling of two or more simulation models in a co-simulation environment (FMI for Co-Simulation).
It is designed both for coupling with subsystem models, which have been exported by their simulator together with its solver as runnable code (<<figure-co-simulation-with-generated-code>>), and for coupling of simulation tools on a single machine (<<figure-co-simulation-with-tool-coupling>>) or as part of a distributed co-simulation (<<figure-distributed-co-simulation>>).
