=== Application Programming Interface

This section contains the interface description to access the input/output data and status information of a Co-Simulation slave from a C program.

==== Variables access in Co-Simulation interface types [[transfer-of-input-output-and-parameters]]

<<input,`Input`>> and <<output>> variables and other variables are accessed via the `fmi3Get{VariableType}` and `fmi3Set{VariableType}` functions, defined in <<get-and-set-variable-values>>.

In order to enable the slave to interpolate the <<continuous>> floating point <<input,`inputs`>> between communication steps, the <<derivative,`derivatives`>> of the <<input,`inputs`>> with respect to time can be provided.
Also, higher <<derivative,`derivatives`>> can be set to allow higher order interpolation.
Whether the slave is able to handle the <<derivative,`derivatives`>> of <<input,`inputs`>> is given by the unsigned integer capability flag `MaxInputDerivativeOrder`. It delivers the maximum order of the input <<derivative>>.

[[fmi3SetInputDerivatives,`fmi3SetInputDerivatives`]]

include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=SetInputDerivatives]
----

[[fmi3GetOutputDerivatives,`fmi3GetOutputDerivatives`]]
[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=GetOutputDerivatives]
----

Both functions have the same arguments:

--
* `valueReferences` is a vector of value references that define the variables whose <<derivative,`derivatives`>> shall be set or get.

* `nValueReferences` is the dimension of the arguments `valueReferences` and `orders`.

* `orders` contains the orders of the respective <<derivative>> (1 means the first <<derivative>>, 0 is not allowed).

* `values` is a vector with the values of the <<derivative,`derivatives`>>.

* `nValues` is the size of the argument `values`.
--

<<fmi3SetInputDerivatives>>::
Sets the n-th time <<derivative>> of <<input>> variables.
Restrictions on using the function are the same as for the `fmi3Set{VariableType}` function.
Different input variables may have different interpolation order.
<<input,`Inputs`>> and their <<derivative,`derivatives`>> are set with respect to the beginning of a communication time step.

<<fmi3GetOutputDerivatives>>::
Retrieves the n-th <<derivative>> of <<output>> values.
Restrictions on using the function are the same as for the `fmi3Get{VariableType}` function.
The returned <<output,`outputs`>> correspond to the current slave time.
E.g. after a successful call to <<fmi3DoStep>> the returned values are related to the end of the communication time step.

To allow interpolation/approximation of the floating point output variables between communication steps (if they are used as inputs for other slaves), the <<derivative,`derivatives`>> of the <<output,`outputs`>> with respect to time can be read.
Whether the slave is able to provide the <<derivative,`derivatives`>> of <<output,`output`>> is given by the unsigned integer capability flag `maxOutputDerivativeOrder`.
It delivers the maximum order of the <<output>> <<derivative, `derivatives`>>.
If the actual order is lower (because the order of integration algorithm is low), the retrieved value is 0.

_[Example: If the internal polynomial is of order 1 and the master inquires the second <<derivative>> of an <<output>>, the slave will return zero.]_

==== Computation in Co-Simulation interface types

The computation of time steps is controlled by the following function.

[[fmi3DoStep,`fmi3DoStep`]]
[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=DoStep]
----

The computation of a time step is started.

* `currentCommunicationPoint` is the current communication point of the master (latexmath:[tc_i]) and

* `communicationStepSize` is the communication step size (latexmath:[hc_i]). `comunicationStepSize` must be latexmath:[> 0.0].

* `noSetFMUStatePriorToCurrentPoint = fmi3True` if `fmi3SetFMUState` will no longer be called for time instants prior to `currentCommunicationPoint` in this simulation run. _[The slave can use this flag to flush a result buffer]_

* `earlyReturn` signals to the Co-Simulation master if the FMU returns early from the `doStep` call (`earlyReturn = fmi3True`) or if the `doStep` was completed successfully (`earlyReturn = fmi3False`).

The slave must integrate until time instant latexmath:[tc_{i+1} = tc_i + hc_i].

_[The calling environment defines the communication points and <<fmi3DoStep>> must synchronize to these points by always integrating exactly to latexmath:[tc_i + hc_i]._
_It is up to <<fmi3DoStep>> how to achieve this.]_

At the first call to <<fmi3DoStep>> after <<fmi3ExitInitializationMode>> was called `currentCommunicationPoint` must be equal to `startTime` as set with <<fmi3EnterInitializationMode>>.

_[Formally, argument `currentCommunicationPoint` is not needed._
_It is present in order to handle a mismatch between the master and the FMU state of the slave: The `currentCommunicationPoint` and the FMU state of the slaves defined by former_ <<fmi3DoStep>> _or_ `fmi3SetFMUState` _calls have to be consistent with respect to each other._
_For example, if the slave does not use the update formula for the <<independent>> variable as required above,_ latexmath:[tc_{i+1} = tc_i + hc_i] _(using argument_ latexmath:[tc_i] = `currentCommunicationPoint` _of_ <<fmi3DoStep>>) _but uses internally an own update formula, such as_ latexmath:[tc_{s,i+1} = tc_{s,i} + hc_{s,i}] _then the slave could use as time increment_ latexmath:[\text{hc}_{s,i} := (tc_i - tc_{s,i}) + hc_i] _(instead of_ latexmath:[\text{hc}_{s,i} := hc_i] _) to avoid a mismatch between the master time_ latexmath:[tc_{i+1}] _and the slave internal time_ latexmath:[tc_{s,i+1}] _for large i.]_


The function returns:

`fmi3OK`::
if the communication step was computed successfully until its end.

`fmi3Discard`::
if the slave computed successfully only a subinterval of the communication step. The FMU enters the *Step Discarded* state, see <<state-step-discarded-co-simulation>> for more information.

`fmi3Error`::
the communication step could not be carried out at all.
The master can try to repeat the step with other input values and/or a different communication step size in the same way as described in the `fmi3Discard` case above.

`fmi3Fatal`::
if an error occurred which corrupted the FMU irreparably.
See <<status-returned-by-functions>> for details.
_[The master should stop the simulation run immediately.]_

It depends on the capabilities of the slave which argument constellations and calling sequences are allowed (see <<fmi-for-basic-co-simulation>>).

==== Retrieving Status Information from the Slave in Co-Simulation Interface Types [[retrieving-status-from-slave]]

Status information is retrieved from the slave by the following function:

[[fmi3GetDoStepDiscardedStatus,`fmi3GetDoStepDiscardedStatus`]]
[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=GetDoStepDiscardedStatus]
----

* If argument `terminate = true`, the slave wants to terminate the simulation.

[[lastSuccessfulTime,`lastSuccessfulTime`]]
* <<lastSuccessfulTime>> is the time instant at which the slave stopped the <<fmi3DoStep>> call.

==== State Machine for Basic Co-Simulation [[state-machine-co-simulation]]

The following state machine defines the supported calling sequences.

.Calling sequence of Co-Simulation C functions in form of an UML 2.0 state machine.
[#figure-co-simulation-state-machine]
image::images/state-machine-co-simulation.svg[width=80%, align="center"]

In this Co-Simulation interface the following functions must not be called: <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>>, <<fmi3NewDiscreteStates>>, <<fmi3EnterEventMode>>, <<fmi3SetClock>>, <<fmi3GetClock>>, <<fmi3SetIntervalFraction>>, <<fmi3GetIntervalFraction>>, <<fmi3SetIntervalDecimal>>, <<fmi3GetIntervalDecimal>> including all functions that are specific to Model Exchange.

===== State: FMU State Setable [[state-fmu-state-setable-co-simulation]]

In all states of this super state it is allowed to call <<fmi3GetFMUState>>, <<fmi3SetFMUState>>, <<fmi3FreeFMUState>>`, <<fmi3SerializedFMUStateSize>>, <<fmi3SerializeFMUState>>, `fmi3DeSerializeFMUState`, <<fmi3Reset>>, <<fmi3GetVersion>>, `fmi3SetDebugLogging` and <<fmi3FreeInstance>>.

If any function returns with `fmi3Fatal` the FMU enters the terminal state.

===== State: Under Evaluation [[state-under-evaluation-co-simulation]]

This super state is entered by the FMU when <<fmi3Instantiate>> is called.
If any function returns `fmi3Error` the FMU enters state *Terminated*.

===== State: Initialized [[state-initialized-co-simulation]]

This super state is entered by the FMU when <<fmi3ExitInitializationMode>> is called.
If the function <<fmi3Terminate>> is called, the FMU enters state *Terminated*.

===== State: Instantiated [[state-instantiated-co-simulation]]

In this state the FMU can do one-time initializations and allocate memory.
The FMU sets all variables to its <<start>> values.

Allowed Function Calls::
<<fmi3EnterInitializationMode>>, <<fmi3SetInputDerivatives>>, <<fmi3EnterConfigurationMode>>

`fmi3Set{VariableType}`::
For variables with <<variability>> latexmath:[\neq] <<constant>> and for which <<initial>> = <<exact>> or <<approx>>.
The intention is to set <<start>> and guess values for these variables.

Forbidden Function Calls::
<<fmi3Instantiate>>, <<fmi3Terminate>>, `fmi3Get{VariableType}`, <<fmi3GetDirectionalDerivative>>, <<fmi3GetOutputDerivatives>>, <<fmi3DoStep>>, <<fmi3DoEarlyReturn>>, <<fmi3ExitInitializationMode>>, <<fmi3GetDoStepDiscardedStatus>>, <<fmi3ExitConfigurationMode>>, <<fmi3EnterStepMode>>

===== State: Initialization Mode [[state-initialization-mode-co-simulation]]
This mode is used by the master to compute consistent initial conditions for overall system.
Therefore iterative calls of `fmi3Set{VariableType}` and `fmi3Get{VariableType}` are allowed.
In between the FMU must evaluate all relevant equations.
In this way artificial or real algebraic loops over connected FMUs in *Initialization Mode* may be handled by using appropriate numerical algorithms.

Allowed Function Calls::
<<fmi3ExitInitializationMode>>, <<fmi3SetInputDerivatives>>, <<fmi3GetDirectionalDerivative>>

`fmi3Set{VariableType}`::
For variables with:
* <<variability>> latexmath:[\neq] <<constant>> that have <<initial>> = <<exact>>, or
* <<causality>> = <<input>>, or
* <<causality>> = to <<parameter>> and <<variability>> = to <<tunable>>.

`fmi3Get{VariableType}`::
For variables with <<causality>> = <<output>> or continuous-time <<state,`states`>> or state derivatives.

Forbidden Function Calls::
<<fmi3Instantiate>>, <<fmi3Terminate>>, <<fmi3DoStep>>, <<fmi3DoEarlyReturn>>, <<fmi3EnterInitializationMode>>, <<fmi3GetDoStepDiscardedStatus>>, <<fmi3EnterConfigurationMode>>, <<fmi3ExitConfigurationMode>>, <<fmi3EnterStepMode>>

===== State: Step Mode [[state-step-mode-co-simulation]]

This state is used by the master to progress simulation time.

Allowed Function Calls::
<<fmi3SetInputDerivatives>>, <<fmi3GetDirectionalDerivative>>, <<fmi3GetOutputDerivatives>>, `fmi3Get{VariableType}`, <<fmi3Terminate>>

<<fmi3EnterConfigurationMode>>::
With this function call the *Reconfiguration Mode* is entered.
This function must not be called if the FMU contains no <<tunable>> <<structuralParameter,`structural parameters`>> (i.e. with <<causality>>= <<structuralParameter>> and <<variability>> = <<tunable>>).

<<fmi3DoStep>>::
Within `fmi3DoStep` the FMU may call <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>>
* If the function returns with `fmi3OK` or `fmi3Warning` the FMU stays in this state.
* If the function returns with `fmi3Discard` the FMU enters state *Step Discarded*.

`fmi3Set{VariableType}`::
For variables with:
* <<causality>> = <<input>>, or
* <<causality>> = <<parameter>> and <<variability>> = <<tunable>>

It is not allowed to call `fmi3Get{VariableType}` functions after `fmi3Set{VariableType}` functions without an <<fmi3DoStep>> call in between.

_[The reason is to avoid different interpretations of the caching, since contrary to FMI for Model Exchange, <<fmi3DoStep>> will perform the actual calculation instead of `fmi3Get{VariableType}`, and therefore, dummy algebraic loops at communication points cannot be handled by an appropriate sequence of `fmi3Get{VariableType}` and, `fmi3Set{VariableType}` calls as for Model Exchange._

===== State: Intermediate Update Mode [[state-intermediate-update-mode-co-simulation]]

In this state the master can retrieve information from the FMU between communication points.
Functions called in this state must not return `fmi3Discard`.

The FMU enters this state by calling <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> within <<fmi3DoStep>> and leaves the state towards state *Step Mode* if the function returns `fmi3OK` or `fmi3Warning`.
If the function returns `fmi3Error` the FMU enters state *Terminated*.
If the function returns `fmi3Fatal` the FMU enters the terminal state.

Allowed Function Calls::
<<fmi3DoEarlyReturn>>

`fmi3Set{VariableType}`, <<fmi3SetInputDerivatives>>::
If <<intermediateVariableSetAllowed,`intermediateVariableSetAllowed = fmi3True`>>, the value of intermediate variables can be set.
Intermediate variables are variables that are marked with attribute <<intermediateAccess,`intermediateAccess = fmi3True`>> in the `modelDescription.xml`.

`fmi3Get{VariableType}`, <<fmi3GetOutputDerivatives>>::
If <<intermediateVariableGetAllowed,`intermediateVariableGetAllowed = fmi3True`>>, the value of intermediate variables can be retrieved.
Intermediate variables are variables that are marked with attribute <<intermediateAccess,`intermediateAccess = fmi3True`>> in the `modelDescription.xml`.

Forbidden Function Calls::
The same functions which are not allowed to be called in *Step Mode* must not be called in this state.
Additionally the following functions must not be called  <<fmi3EnterConfigurationMode>>, <<fmi3Terminate>>, <<fmi3DoStep>>, <<fmi3GetDirectionalDerivative>>.

===== State: Reconfiguration Mode [[state-reconfiguration-mode-co-simulation]]

In this state <<structuralParameter,`structural parameters`>> with <<variability>> = <<tunable>> can be changed.
This state is entered from state *Step Mode* by calling <<fmi3EnterConfigurationMode>> and left back to *Step Mode* by calling <<fmi3ExitConfigurationMode>>.

Allowed Function Calls::
<<fmi3ExitConfigurationMode>>

`fmi3Set{VariableType}`::
Only for variables with <<causality>> = <<structuralParameter>> and <<variability>> = <<tunable>>.

Forbidden Function Calls::

===== State: Step Discarded [[state-step-discarded-co-simulation]]

The FMU changes into this state if it is not able to compute a communication step completely by returning `fmi3Discard` from <<fmi3DoStep>>.
This might have been caused by numerical problems or intended stop of the simulation run.
The master can call <<fmi3GetDoStepDiscardedStatus>> to get further information.
In case of numerical problems the master may try to achieve a correct solution for example by repeating the last step with a different communication step size. _[Redoing a step is only possible if the FMU state has been recorded at the beginning of the current (discarded) step with <<fmi3GetFMUState>>._
_Redoing a step is performed by calling `fmi3SetFMUState` and afterwards calling <<fmi3DoStep>> with the new communicationStepSize._
_Note that it is not possible to change `currentCommunicationPoint` in such a call.]_
The master can also continue from the <<lastSuccessfulTime>>.
It does not enter into this state if the FMU returns early from a communication step caused by <<fmi3DoEarlyReturn>>.

Allowed Function Calls::
<<fmi3Terminate>>, `fmi3Get{VariableType}`, <<fmi3GetDirectionalDerivative>>, <<fmi3GetOutputDerivatives>>, <<fmi3SetFMUState>>

<<fmi3GetDoStepDiscardedStatus>>::
The master calls this functions to retrieve information about the reason for discarding the last communication step.

<<fmi3EnterStepMode>>::
The <<fmi3EnterStepMode>> function pushes the FMU from *Step Discarded* to *Step Mode*.
_[In *Step Mode*, the master may change again FMU <<input,`inputs`>> and <<parameter,`parameters`>>, or push the FMU into other states]_
In this case, a new step may be started from <<lastSuccessfulTime>> which can be retrieved by the <<fmi3GetDoStepDiscardedStatus>> function in state *Step Discarded*.

Forbidden Function Calls::
<<fmi3EnterConfigurationMode>>, <<fmi3ExitConfigurationMode>>, <<fmi3Instantiate>>, <<fmi3EnterInitializationMode>>, <<fmi3ExitInitializationMode>>, <<fmi3DoStep>>, `fmi3Set{VariableType}`, <<fmi3DoEarlyReturn>>, <<fmi3SetInputDerivatives>>

==== Code Example for Basic Co-Simulation

In the following example, the usage of the FMI functions is sketched in order to clarify the typical calling sequence of the functions in a simulation environment.
We consider two slaves, where both have one <<continuous>> floating point <<input>> and one <<continuous>> floating point <<output>> which are connected in the following way:

.Connection graph of the slaves.
image::images/co-simulation-connection-of-slaves.svg[width=30%, align="center"]

We assume no algebraic dependency between input and <<output>> of each slave.
The code demonstrates the simplest master algorithm as shown in <<math-basic-co-simulation>>:

[start=8]
. Constant communication step size.
. No repeating of communication steps.
. The slaves do not support asynchronous execution of <<fmi3DoStep>>.

The error handling is implemented in a very rudimentary way.

==== Early-return Requested by the Co-Simulation Master in Co-Simulation Interface Types [[earlyreturn-co-simulation]]

[[canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate,`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate`]]
The Boolean capability flag <<canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate>> in the modelDescription XML file indicates whether the FMU supports the early-return feature.
The default value of this capability flag is `false`.
Each time an internal discontinuity or an event happens inside an FMU with capability flag <<canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate,`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate = fmi3True`>>, the callback function <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> is invoked by the FMU.
The master can only use this early return functionality if it provides the <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> callback function pointer in the instantiate function.

[[fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate,`fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate`]]
[source, c]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tag=CallbackIntermediateUpdate]
----

The Co-Simulation master can request the FMU to end the <<fmi3DoStep>> at a Newtonian time instant and to do an early return by calling the <<fmi3DoEarlyReturn>> function inside the callback function <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>>.
The Co-Simulation master is only allowed to call this function, if <<canReturnEarly,`canReturnEarly = fmi3True`>>.
If the master does not call <<fmi3DoEarlyReturn>> the FMU continues the <<fmi3DoStep>> computation until the next predefined communication instant (i.e., `currentCommunicationPoint + communicationStepSize`) or until the next call of <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>>.

[[fmi3DoEarlyReturn,`fmi3DoEarlyReturn`]]
[source, c]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tag=DoEarlyReturn]
----

[[earlyReturnTime,`earlyReturnTime`]]
The FMU should return early from the current <<fmi3DoStep>> at the time instant defined by argument <<earlyReturnTime>>.

If the <<earlyReturnTime>> is greater than the last signaled <<intermediateUpdateTime>>, the FMU may integrate up to the time instant <<earlyReturnTime>>.

If the early return is conducted successfully by the FMU it must set the argument `earlyReturn` to `fmi3True` in <<fmi3DoStep>> and return `fmi3OK`.
In that case the internal simulation time of the FMU equals the value of <<earlyReturnTime>> of the last <<fmi3DoEarlyReturn>> call.

If the requested <<earlyReturnTime>> is less than the last signaled <<intermediateUpdateTime>> or the FMU can not reach the requested <<earlyReturnTime>> for other reasons, the FMU must set the argument `earlyReturn` to `fmi3True` in <<fmi3DoStep>> and return `fmi3Discard` and enter state *Step Discarded*.

In state *Step Discarded* the Co-Simulation master can retrieve the <<lastSuccessfulTime>> via calling <<fmi3GetDoStepDiscardedStatus>>.
The Co-Simulation master can decide if a rollback of the FMU to reach the <<earlyReturnTime>> time is required or it may continue the simulation from <<lastSuccessfulTime>> for that FMU.
Note that *Event Mode* is not supported in Basic Co-Simulation and Scheduled Co-Simulation.
