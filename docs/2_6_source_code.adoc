=== Definition of Source Code [[fmiSourceCode]]

A source code FMU contains the sources of the model in the `sources` directory together with a `buildDescription.xml` that contains at least one `<BuildConfiguration>` element for the supported platforms.
Each `<BuildConfiguration>` provides the necessary information to compile and link the sources of the model into a dynamic library or as part of an executable.
An FMU importing tool may not regard more than one `<BuildConfiguration>` when building the FMU for a specific `<platform>`.
The importer chooses the matching `<BuildConfiguration>` based on the `<platform>` and `<modelIdentifier>` attributes.

.BuildConfiguration attribute details.

|====
|Attribute
|Description

|`modelIdentifier`
|The attribute `modelIdentifier` of the `<ModelExchange>`, `<CoSimulation>` or `<ScheduledExecution>` elements this build configuration is associated with.

|`platform`
|Platform tuple of the platform the `<BuildConfiguration>` is intended for (e.g. `x86_64-linux`).
All `platform` attributes defined in the `<BuildConfiguration>` elements for the same `<modelIdentifier>` must be unique.
For each `platform` there can only be one matching `<BuildConfiguration>`.
This attribute is optional.
Thus there must not be more than one `<BuildConfiguration>` without a `platform` attribute.
If a `<BuildConfiguration>` without a `platform` attribute is provided this is the fallback `<BuildConfiguration>` an importer can use if it cannot find any other `<BuildConfiguration>` with a matching `platform` attribute.

==== SourceFileSet

The `<SourceFileSet>` element groups source files that can be compiled with the same compiler and compiler options.
Every build configuration must contain at least one `<SourceFileSet>`.
An importer of the FMU has to regard every `<SourceFileSet>` of the matching `<BuildConfiguration>`.

|Attribute
|Description

|`language`
|Language of the source files (e.g. `C99`, `C++11`)

|`compiler`
|The compiler to compile the sources (e.g. `VisualC`, `gcc`, `clang++`)

|`compilerOptions`
|The compiler flags that have to be used when compiling the sources (e.g. `-fno-rtti`, `/Od`)

|`name`
|Path of the source file relative to the `sources` directory

===== PreprocessorDefinition

The `<PreprocessorDefinition>` element defines a preprocessor definition that needs to be passed to the compiler when compiling the source files in the `<SourceFileSet>`.

|Attribute
|Description

|`name`
|Name of the preprocessor definition

|`value`
|Value of the preprocessor definition

|`optional`
|Determines wether the definition is optional (default is `false`)

===== PreprocessorDefinition/Option

The `<Option>` element defines a possible value for the `<PreprocessorDefinition>`.
If a `<PreprocessorDefinition>` contains `<Option>` elements, its default value must be contained in the options.

===== IncludeDirectory

The `<IncludeDirectory>` element defines the include directories that need to be passed to the compiler when compiling the source files in the `<SourceFileSet>`.

.IncludeDirectory attribute details.

|`name`
|Path of the include directory relative to the `sources` directory

_[Note that the header files `fmi3PlatformTypes.h` and `fmi3FunctionTypes.h/fmi3Functions.h` are not included in the FMU because:_

_pass:[]`fmi3PlatformTypes.h` makes no sense in the `sources` directory, because if sources are provided, then the importer defines this header file and not the FMU._ +
_This header file is not included in the `binaries` directory, because it is implicitly defined by the platform directory (for example, `i686-windows` for a 32-bit machine or `x86_64-linux` for a 64-bit machine)._

_pass:[]`fmi3FunctionTypes.h` / `fmi3Functions.h` are not needed in the `sources` directory, because they are implicitly defined by attribute `fmiVersion` in file <<modelDescription.xml>>._
_Furthermore, in order that the C compiler can check for consistent function arguments, the header file from the importer should be used when compiling the C sources._
_It would therefore be counter-productive (unsafe) if this header file was present._ +
_These header files are not included in the `binaries` directory, since they are already utilized to build the executable of the simulation environment._
_The version number of the header file used to construct the FMU can be deduced via attribute `fmiVersion` in file <<modelDescription.xml>> or via function call <<fmi3GetVersion>>.]_

==== Library

The `<Library>` element defines a static library required to link the model binary.
An importer of the FMU has to link every library of the matching `<BuildConfiguration>`.

.Library attribute details.
[[table-Library-details]]
[cols="1,3a",options="header"]
|====
|Attribute
|Description

|`name`
|Name of the library

|`version`
|Version specifier of the library as defined in https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-specifiers[PEP 440].
The characters `>` (greater-than) and `<` (less-than) must be escaped as `&gt;` and `&lt;`.
 _[For example `2.5`, `>=2.0,<3.0` or `>=1.0,!=1.2`]_.

|`external`
|Boolean attribute that determines wether the library is contained in the `binaries/<platform_tuple>` directory (`false`) or if it has to be provided by the environment (`true`).
The default is `false`.
