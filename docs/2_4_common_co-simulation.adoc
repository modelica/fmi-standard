=== Common Concepts for Co-Simulation [[common-concepts-cosim]]

//TODO: This should not overlap with the other cosim types.

Co-simulation exploits the modular structure of coupled problems in all stages of the simulation process beginning with the separate model setup and preprocessing for the individual subsystems in different simulation tools (which can be powerful simulators as well as simple C programs).
During time integration, the simulation is again performed independently for all subsystems restricting the data exchange between subsystems to discrete communication points latexmath:[tc_i].
For simulator coupling, also the visualization and post-processing of simulation data is done individually for each subsystem in its own native simulation tool.
In different contexts, the communication points latexmath:[tc_i], the communication steps latexmath:[tc_i \rightarrow tc_{i+1}] and the communication step sizes latexmath:[hc_i := tc_{i+1} - tc_i] are also known as sampling points (synchronization points), macro steps and sampling rates, respectively.
The term "communication point" in FMI for Co-Simulation refers to the communication between subsystems in a co-simulation environment and should not be mixed with the output points for saving simulation results to file.

FMI for Co-Simulation provides 3 interface standards for the solution of time-dependent coupled systems consisting of subsystems that are continuous in time (model components that are described by non-stationary differential equations) or time-discrete (model components that are described by difference equations such as discrete controllers).
In a block representation of the coupled system, the subsystems are represented by blocks with (internal) <<state>> variables latexmath:[x(t)] that are connected to other subsystems (blocks) of the coupled problem by _subsystem <<input,`inputs`>>_ latexmath:[u(t)] and _subsystem <<output,`outputs`>>_ latexmath:[y(t)].
In this framework, the physical connections between subsystems are represented by mathematical coupling conditions between the inputs latexmath:[u(t)] and the <<output,`outputs`>> latexmath:[y(t)] of all subsystems, <<KS00>>.

For co-simulation, two basic groups of functions have to be implemented:

. functions for the data exchange between subsystems

. functions to synchronize the simulation of all subsystems and to proceed in communication steps latexmath:[tc_i \rightarrow tc_{i+1}] from initial time latexmath:[tc_0 := t_{start}] to end time latexmath:[tc_N := t_{stop}]

// TODO: Add "A Co-sim interface..."
In FMI for Co-Simulation, both functions are implemented in one software component, the Co-Simulation master.
The data exchange between the subsystems (slaves) is handled via the master only.
There is no direct communication between the slaves.
The master functionality can be implemented by a special software tool (a separate simulation backplane) or by one of the involved simulation tools.
In its most general form, the coupled system may be simulated in nested co-simulation environments and FMI for Co-Simulation applies to each level of the hierarchy.

// TODO: Add "A Co-sim interface..."
FMI for Co-Simulation defines interface routines for the communication between the master and all slaves (subsystems) in a co-simulation environment.
The most common master algorithm stops at each communication point latexmath:[tc_i] the simulation (time integration) of all slaves, collects the outputs latexmath:[y(tc_i)] from all subsystems, evaluates the subsystem inputs latexmath:[u(tc_i)], distributes these subsystem inputs to the slaves and continues the (co-)simulation with the next communication step latexmath:[tc_i \rightarrow tc_{i+1} = tc_i + hc] with fixed communication step size latexmath:[hc].
In each slave, an appropriate solver is used to integrate one of the subsystems for a given communication step latexmath:[tc_i \rightarrow tc_{i+1}].
The most simple co-simulation algorithms approximate the (unknown) subsystem inputs latexmath:[u(t), (t > tc_i))] by frozen data latexmath:[u(tc_i)] for latexmath:[tc_i \leq t < tc_{i+1}].
FMI for Co-Simulation supports this classical brute force approach as well as more sophisticated master algorithms.
FMI for Co-Simulation is designed to support a very general class of master algorithms but it does not define the master algorithm itself.


The ability of slaves to support more sophisticated master algorithms is characterized by a set of capability flags inside the XML description of the slave (see <<fmi-for-basic-co-simulation>>).
Typical examples are:

- the ability to handle variable communication step sizes latexmath:[hc_i],

- the ability to repeat a rejected communication step latexmath:[tc_i \rightarrow tc_{i+1}] with reduced communication step size,

- the ability to provide <<derivative,`derivatives`>> of <<output,`outputs`>> w.r.t. time, to allow interpolation (<<transfer-of-input-output-and-parameters>>),

- or the ability to provide Jacobians.

FMI for Co-Simulation is restricted to slaves with the following properties:

. All calculated values are time-dependent functions within an a priori defined time interval latexmath:[t_{start} \leq t \leq t_{stop}] (provided `stopTimeDefined = fmi3True` when calling <<fmi3EnterInitializationMode>>).

. All simulations are carried out with increasing time in general.
The current time latexmath:[t] is running step by step from latexmath:[t_{start}] to latexmath:[t_{stop}].
The algorithm of the slave may have the property to be able to repeat the simulation of parts of latexmath:[[t_{start}, t_{stop}]] or the whole time interval latexmath:[[t_{start}, t_{stop}]].

. The slave can be given a time value latexmath:[tc_i, t_{start} \leq tc_i \leq t_{stop}].

. The slave is able to interrupt the simulation when latexmath:[tc_i] is reached.

. During the interrupted simulation, the slave (and its individual solver) can receive values for <<input,`inputs`>> latexmath:[u(tc_i)] and send values of outputs latexmath:[y(tc_i)].

. Whenever the simulation in a slave is interrupted, a new time value latexmath:[tc_{i+1}, tc_i \leq tc_{i+1} \leq t_{stop}], can be given to simulate the time subinterval latexmath:[tc_i < t \leq tc_{i+1}]

. The subinterval length latexmath:[hc_i] is the communication step size of the latexmath:[i^{th}] communication step, latexmath:[hc_i = tc_{i+1} - tc_i].

The communication step size has to be greater than zero.

FMI for Co-Simulation allows a Co-Simulation flow which starts with instantiation and initialization (all slaves are prepared for computation, the communication links are established), followed by simulation (the slaves are forced to simulate a communication step), and finishes with shutdown.
The details of the flow are given in the state machine of the calling sequences from master to slave, for each co-simulation interface (see <<state-machine-co-simulation>>, <<state-machine-calling-sequence-clocked-co-simulation>>, and <<state-machine-scheduled-co-simulation>>).

==== Intermediate Variable Access Support [[math-intermediate-variable-access]]

Intermediate variable access has three main uses:

. *An FMU is able to produce valid output variables at intermediate points between two consecutive communication points.*
This is typically the result of an internal solver taking multiple integration steps between two consecutive communication points.
The FMU exposes intermediate output variables for the master whenever they are available.
These can be used, for e.g., for extrapolation, interpolation, filtering or asynchronous co-simulation.

. *Intermediate <<input>> variables for an FMU is available in the Co-Simulation master.*
The FMU requests updated intermediate <<input>> variables every time they are required by the internal solver.
This can be either at temporary solver states or after successful integration steps.

. *Intermediate <<input>> variables for the FMU can be computed by the Co-Simulation master.*
The computation requires intermediate output variables from the FMU.
Whenever the internal solver in the FMU needs updated intermediate <<input>> variables, it provides the intermediate output variables for and requests the intermediate <<input>> variables from the master.

Combinations of the above methods are also allowed.

Access to intermediate variables enables several features such as:

* Advanced interpolation/extrapolation techniques,
* Asynchronous communication,
* Anti-alias filtering, and
* Smoothing of inputs.

==== Overview of Different Co-Simulation Interfaces

In FMI version 3.0 the following new features have been added:

* signaling of <<clock>> ticks (i.e. events/interrupts) from the FMU to simulation environment
* signaling of <<clock>> ticks from simulation environment to the FMU
* definition of multiple model rates (periodic, variable/triggerable) in one FMU
* access to intermediate values of the FMU's variables between two communication points

Please refer to the different sections for a more detailed explanation of the motivation and use of the new features.

===== Basic Co-Simulation

Basic Co-Simulation is a rather general approach to the simulation of coupled technical systems and coupled physical phenomena in engineering with focus on non-stationary (time-dependent) problems.
The Basic Co-Simulation interface is similar to the feature set of FMI 2.0 for Co-Simulation.
The asynchronous mode for FMUs has been removed since this mode was not supported by tools and it can be suitably replaced by Co-Simulation master implementations that control the asynchronous computation of FMUs via separate tasks/threads created for each FMU.

===== Hybrid Co-Simulation

The <<hybrid-co-simulation-api,Hybrid Co-Simulation>> interface provides functionalities to control and observe the ticking of <<clock,clocks>>.
For FMI for Hybrid Co-Simulation, the ticking of a clock is interpreted as an activity of the associated model partition.
During simulation, the Co-Simulation master updates and manages values of inputs and outputs of FMUs and further models at communication points for each model partition.
The ratio between communication points created for a model partition and time can be seen as a model rate.
In that sense multiple model partitions of a model define multiple model rates in a model.

===== Scheduled Co-Simulation

The <<hybrid-co-simulation-api,Hybrid Co-Simulation>> interface provides an indirect control over the computation of model partitions.
With <<scheduled-co-simulation-api,Scheduled Co-Simulation>> a simulation master can directly control the time of computation (i.e. scheduling) for such model partitions.

The Scheduled Co-Simulation interface addresses simulation use cases with the following requirements:

* At any time (even for unpredictable events), an event can be signaled to an FMU;
* If multiple FMUs share (execution) resources, the time requirements (e.g. execution time, communication deadlines) of all model partitions have to be observed and respected;
** Time requirements may exist due to communication constraints (that are not apparent at FMU simulation level) which have to be fulfilled by the simulation master;
** That requires a global execution order and preemption policy for all model partitions of the multiple FMUs
** Priority information provided by the FMUs has to be evaluated and merged to an overall priority for available model partitions
* Data shall move between the different FMU model partitions for the same or next activation time.
** Get/set operations must also be possible for the same activation time for different model partitions between the computation of these model partitions.
* This Co-Simulation interface provides support for concurrent computation of model partitions (i.e. a support of multiple rates) on a single computational resource (e.g. CPU-core) of an FMU.
For that a preemptive multitasking regime is intended (cooperative multitasking is not covered by this description).

_[A parallel computation of model partitions is not part of the FMI 3.0 API._
_An FMU may still internally use parallel computation on multiple cores, but handling this is (currently) not part of the FMI standard. Such an internal parallel computation is not visible to the simulation master._
_It is a tool vendor specific solution that has ties to the used OS and the co-simulation environment.]_

[[intermediate-variable-access]]
===== Intermediate Variable Access

An FMU can inform a Co-Simulation master that is able to provide intermediate output variables and/or receive intermediate input variables at any time, i.e. not only at the end of a current <<fmi3DoStep>> function call.
It is possible for the FMU to inform the master whether the internal solver is in a temporary state or if it has just completed an internal integration step.
If the internal solver is in a temporary state, intermediate output variables shall only be used for directly computing intermediate input variables.
If the internal integration step is completed, the master can forward intermediate outputs to interconnected simulation units.

Intermediate variable access can be activated in all Co-Simulation interface types, if the FMU and the master supports it.
More information can be found in <<intermediate-variable-access>>.

===== Coupling Scenarios

<<figure-co-simulation-with-generated-code>> and <<figure-co-simulation-with-tool-coupling>> illustrate the most common Co-Simulation coupling scenarios.

.Co-Simulation with generated code on a single computer (for simplicity shown for one slave only).
[#figure-co-simulation-with-generated-code]
image::images/co-simulation-single-slave.svg[width=50%, align="center"]

.Co-Simulation with tool coupling on a single computer (for simplicity shown for one slave only).
[#figure-co-simulation-with-tool-coupling]
image::images/co-simulation-tool-coupling.svg[width=70%, align="center"]

In the tool coupling case (<<figure-co-simulation-with-tool-coupling>>) the FMU implementation wraps the FMI function calls to API calls which are provided by the simulation tool (for example, a COM or CORBA API).
Additionally to the FMU, the simulation tool is needed to run a co-simulation.

In its most general form, a tool coupling based co-simulation is implemented on distributed hardware with subsystems being handled by different computers with different operating systems (cluster computer, computer farm, computers at different locations).
The data exchange and communication between the subsystems is typically performed using one of the network communication technologies (for example, MPI, TCP/IP).
The definition of this communication layer is not part of the FMI standard.
However, distributed co-simulation scenarios can be implemented using FMI as shown in <<figure-distributed-co-simulation>>.

.Distributed co-simulation infrastructure (for simplicity shown for one slave only).
[#figure-distributed-co-simulation]
image::images/co-simulation-distributed-infrastructure.svg[width=90%, align="center"]

The master has to implement the communication layer.
Additional parameters for establishing the network communication (for example, identification of the remote computer, port numbers, user account) are to be set via the GUI of the master.
This data is not transferred via the FMI API.

The Co-Simulation master signals to the FMU which features shall be used for the current instance of the FMU in <<fmi3Instantiate>>.

If the FMU does not support the Co-Simulation interface selected in <<fmi3Instantiate>>, it has to return a null pointer.

===== Multiple Co-Simulation Interface Support in one FMU::
Exporters are encouraged to support multiple Co-Simulation interfaces in one FMU, so it can be used in differently capable Co-Simulation master implementations and for different use cases.
To indicate support for a specific Co-Simulation interface, the `<fmiModelDescription>` must have the respective Co-Simulation element present. +
_[That improves the reusability of FMUs._
_A common application of this multiple mode support is the reuse of FMUs for real-time and non-real-time simulations.]_ +
The described multi-mode support is based on wrapping functionality into the <<fmi3DoStep>> function by emulating missing features of the Co-Simulation interface, the FMU has been specifically exported for. +
_[An FMU that supports <<scheduled-co-simulation-api,Scheduled Co-Simulation>> will in most cases also support <<hybrid-co-simulation-api,Hybrid Co-Simulation>>._
_Wrapping towards other Co-Simulation interfaces can influence the simulation results._
_Depending on the model, wrapping towards the Basic Co-Simulation interface may result in divergent simulation results._
_Especially aperiodic <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> can not always be sufficiently emulated in modes that do not directly support <<clock,`clocks`>>._
_Therefore it is recommended that the FMU provides logging information to the user about the influence of the current mode on simulation results, if non-optimal modes are used by the simulation environment.]_

==== Common Co-Simulation Application Programming Interface

// TODO: Common co-simulation API parts.

===== Early Return [[api-early-return]]
In FMI 3.0, an FMU is allowed to stop the execution of <<fmi3DoStep>> and return without reaching the predefined communication instant, i.e. `currentCommunicationPoint + communicationStepSize`.
This mechanism is called "early return".
With the early return feature, an FMU can signal <<outputClock>> events or internal state changes, i.e., discontinuity events to the Co-Simulation master at any time (not only at the end of <<fmi3DoStep>> function calls).
When an internal event occurs inside the FMU at a time instant, it informs the master that a new communication point for the Co-Simulation can be created.
Note that an event signal is not seen in the narrow sense of solver induced discontinuity events but in the general sense of a simulation event that has to be handled by the Co-Simulation master (e.g. state changes that require extended handling).
On a multi-node architecture, in particular, significant co-simulation speed-up may be obtained if the Co-Simulation master can avoid waiting until the end of the slowest <<fmi3DoStep>> when many FMUs are integrating in parallel and an event occurred.
To exploit such efficiency gains, the Co-Simulation master can command the FMU to return early from the current communication step.
This is even helpful if the FMU or the Co-Simulation master do not support the advanced handling of events based on the <<hybrid-co-simulation-api, Hybrid Co-Simulation>> functionalities.
In this way multiple event types and also <<outputClock>> ticks or interrupts can be supported based on the early return functionality and additional functionalities provided by <<hybrid-co-simulation-api,Hybrid Co-Simulation>>.

===== Intermediate Variable Access [[api-intermediate-variable-access]]

If the Co-Simulation master signals the support for intermediate variable access and an FMU has at least one variable with <<intermediateAccess,`intermediateAccess = fmi3True`>>, the FMU can use the callback function <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> to communicate information back to the Co-Simulation master.

[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tag=CallbackIntermediateUpdate]
----

The following output arguments in <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> are used for intermediate variable access:

* <<intermediateUpdateTime>> is the simulation time at which the <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> callback function is called by the FMU.

* If <<intermediateVariableSetAllowed,`intermediateVariableSetAllowed = fmi3True`>>, the Co-Simulation master may provide intermediate <<input>> variables by calling `fmi3Set{VariableType}` for variables with <<intermediateAccess,`intermediateAccess = fmi3True`>>.

* If <<intermediateVariableGetAllowed,`intermediateVariableGetAllowed = fmi3True`>>, the Co-Simulation master may collect intermediate output variables by calling `fmi3Get{VariableType}` for variables with <<intermediateAccess,`intermediateAccess = fmi3True`>>.

* If <<intermediateStepFinished, `intermediateStepFinished = fmi3False`>>, the Co-Simulation master shall only use intermediate output variables to compute intermediate <<input>> variables at the current state.

Hence, it is important to distinguish intermediate output from successful internal integration steps from intermediate outputs valid only for temporary solver states.
<<figure-intermediate-variable-access>> shows an overview of the solver states and the intended use of intermediate variable access.
It is not allowed to call <<intermediateUpdate>> for a simulation time point prior to a previous call with <<intermediateStepFinished,`intermediateStepFinished = fmi3True`>>.
