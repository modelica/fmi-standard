=== FMI Application Programming Interface

This section contains the interface description to access the in/output data and status information of a co-simulation slave from a C program.

==== Transfer of Input / Output Values and Parameters [[transfer-of-input-output-and-parameters]]

Input and output variables and variables are transferred via the `fmi3GetXXX` and `fmi3SetXXX` functions, defined in <<get-and-set-variable-values>>.

In order to enable the slave to interpolate the continuous real inputs between communication steps, the derivatives of the inputs with respect to time can be provided.
Also, higher derivatives can be set to allow higher order interpolation.
Whether a slave is able to interpolate and therefore needs this information is provided by the capability attribute `canInterpolateInputs`.

[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=SetInputDerivatives]
----

Sets the n-th time derivative of real input variables.
Argument `vr` is a vector of value references that define the variables whose derivatives shall be set.
The array `order` contains the orders of the respective derivative (1 means the first derivative, 0 is not allowed).
Argument "value" is a vector with the values of the derivatives.
`nValueReferences` is the dimension of the vectors. +
Restrictions on using the function are the same as for the `fmi3SetReal` function.

Inputs and their derivatives are set with respect to the beginning of a communication time step.

To allow interpolation/approximation of the real output variables between communication steps (if they are used as inputs for other slaves), the derivatives of the outputs with respect to time can be read.
Whether the slave is able to provide the derivatives of outputs is given by the unsigned integer capability flag `MaxOutputDerivativeOrder`.
It delivers the maximum order of the output derivative.
If the actual order is lower (because the order of integration algorithm is low), the retrieved value is 0.

_[Example: If the internal polynomial is of order 1 and the master inquires the second derivative of an output, the slave will return zero.]_

The derivatives can be retrieved by:

[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=GetOutputDerivatives]
----

Retrieves the n-th derivative of output values.
Argument `vr` is a vector of `nValueReferences` value references that define the variables whose derivatives shall be retrieved.
The array `order` contains the order of the respective derivative (1 means the first derivative, 0 is not allowed).
Argument `value` is a vector with the actual values of the derivatives. +
Restrictions on using the function are the same as for the `fmi3GetReal` function.

The returned outputs correspond to the current slave time.
E.g. after a successful `fmi3DoStep(...)` the returned values are related to the end of the communication time step.

This standard supports polynomial interpolation and extrapolation as well as more sophisticated signal extrapolation schemes like rational extrapolation, see the companion document "FunctionalMockupInterface-ImplementationHints.pdf".

==== Computation

The computation of time steps is controlled by the following function.

[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=DoStep]
----

The computation of a time step is started. +
Argument `currentCommunicationPoint` is the current communication point of the master (latexmath:[tc_i]) and argument `communicationStepSize` is the communication step size (latexmath:[hc_i]).
The latter must be latexmath:[> 0.0].
The slave must integrate until time instant latexmath:[tc_{i+1} = tc_i + hc_i].
_[The calling environment defines the communication points and `fmi3DoStep` must synchronize to these points by always integrating exactly to latexmath:[tc_i + hc_i].
It is up to `fmi3DoStep` how to achieve this.]_
At the first call to `fmi3DoStep` after `fmi3ExitInitializationMode` was called `currentCommunicationPoint` must be equal to `startTime` as set with `fmi3SetupExperiment`.
_[Formally, argument `currentCommunicationPoint` is not needed.
It is present in order to handle a mismatch between the master and the FMU state of the slave: The `currentCommunicationPoint` and the FMU state of the slaves defined by former_ `fmi3DoStep` _or_ `fmi3SetFMUState` _calls have to be consistent with respect to each other.
For example, if the slave does not use the update formula for the independent variable as required above,_ latexmath:[tc_{i+1} = tc_i + hc_i] _(using argument_ latexmath:[tc_i] = `currentCommunicationPoint` _of_ `fmi3DoStep`) _but uses internally an own update formula, such as_ latexmath:[tc_{s,i+1} = tc_{s,i} + hc_{s,i}] _then the slave could use as time increment_ latexmath:[\text{hc}_{s,i} := (tc_i - tc_{s,i}) + hc_i] _(instead of_ latexmath:[\text{hc}_{s,i} := hc_i] _) to avoid a mismatch between the master time_ latexmath:[tc_{i+1}] _and the slave internal time_ latexmath:[tc_{s,i+1}] _for large i.]_

Argument `noSetFMUStatePriorToCurrentPoint` is `fmi3True` if `fmi3SetFMUState` will no longer be called for time instants prior to `currentCommunicationPoint` in this simulation run _[the slave can use this flag to flush a result buffer]_.

The function returns: +
`fmi3OK` - if the communication step was computed successfully until its end. +
`fmi3Discard` - if the slave computed successfully only a subinterval of the communication step.
The master can call the appropriate `fmi3GetXXXStatus` functions to get further information.
If possible, the master should retry the simulation with a shorter communication step size.
_[Redoing a step is only possible if the FMU state has been recorded at the beginning of the current (failed) step with `fmi3GetFMUState`.
Redoing a step is performed by calling `fmi3SetFMUState` and afterwards calling `fmi3DoStep` with the new communicationStepSize.
Note that it is not possible to change `currentCommunicationPoint` in such a call.]_ +
`fmi3Error` - the communication step could not be carried out at all.
The master can try to repeat the step with other input values and/or a different communication step size in the same way as described in the `fmi3Discard` case above. +
`fmi3Fatal` - if an error occurred which corrupted the FMU irreparably.
_[The master should stop the simulation run immediatlely.]_
See <<status-returned-by-functions>> for details.

It depends on the capabilities of the slave which parameter constellations and calling sequences are allowed (see <<CoSimulation>>)

==== State Machine of Calling Sequence from Master to Slave [[state-machine-co-simulation]]

The following state machine defines the supported calling sequences.

.Calling sequence of Co-Simulation C functions in form of an UML 2.0 state machine.
image:images/figure11.png[]

Each state of the state machine corresponds to a certain phase of a simulation as follows:

instantiated::
In this state, start and guess values (= variables that have `initial` = `"exact"` or `"approx"`) can be set.

Configuration Mode:
In this state structural parameters with `variability` = `fixed` or `variability` = `tunable` can be changed.
This state is entered from state *instantiated* by calling `fmi3EnterConfigurationMode()` and left back to *instantiated* by calling `fmi3ExitConfigurationMode()`.
`fmi3EnterConfigurationMode()` can only be called if the FMU contains at least one structural parameter.

Initialization Mode::
In this state, equations are active to determine all outputs (and optionally other variables exposed by the exporting tool).
The variables that can be retrieved by `fmi3GetXXX` calls are (1) defined in the XML file under `<ModelStructure><InitialUnknowns>`, and (2) variables with `causality` = `"output"`.
Variables with `initial` = `"exact"`, as well as variables with `variability` = `"input"` can be set.

slaveInitialized::
In this state, the slave is initialized and the co-simulation computation is performed. The calculation until the next communication point is performed with function `fmi3DoStep`. Depending on the return value, the slave is in a different state (*step Complete*, *step Failed*, *step Canceled*).

Reconfiguration Mode::
In this state structural parameters with `variability` = `tunable` can be changed.
This state is entered from state *stepComplete* by calling `fmi3EnterConfigurationMode()` and left back to *stepComplete* by calling `fmi3ExitConfigurationMode()`.
`fmi3EnterConfigurationMode()` can only be called if the FMU contains at least one structural parameter.

terminated::
In this state, the solution at the final time of the simulation can be retrieved.

Note that in *Initialization Mode* input variables can be set with `fmi3SetXXX` and output variables can be retrieved with `fmi3GetXXX` interchangeably according to the model structure defined under element `<ModelStructure><InitialUnknowns>` in the XML file.
_[For example, if one output `y1` depends on two inputs `u1`, `u2`, then these two inputs must be set, before `y1` can be retrieved.
If additionally an output `y2` depends on an input `u3`, then `u3` can be set and `y2` can be retrieved afterwards.
As a result, artificial or "real" algebraic loops over connected FMUs in *Initialization Mode* can be handled by using appropriate numerical algorithms.]_

There is the additional restriction in *slaveInitialized* state that it is not allowed to call `fmi3GetXXX` functions after `fmi3SetXXX` functions without an `fmi3DoStep` call in between.

_[The reason is to avoid different interpretations of the caching, since contrary to FMI for Model Exchange, `fmi3DoStep` will perform the actual calculation instead of `fmi3GetXXX`, and therefore, dummy algebraic loops at communication points cannot be handeled by an appropriate sequence of `fmi3GetXXX` and, `fmi3SetXXX` calls as for ModelExchange.

==== Code Example

In the following example, the usage of the FMI functions is sketched in order to clarify the typical calling sequence of the functions in a simulation environment.
We consider two slaves, where both have one continuous real input and one continuous real output which are connected in the following way:

.Connection graph of the slaves.
image::images/co-simulation-connection-of-slaves.svg[width=30%, align="center"]

We assume no algebraic dependency between input and output of each slave.
The code demonstrates the simplest master algorithm as shown in <<math-co-simulation>>:

[start=8]
. Constant communication step size.
. No repeating of communication steps.
. The slaves do not support asynchronous execution of `fmi3DoStep`.

The error handling is implemented in a very rudimentary way.
