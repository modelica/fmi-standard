=== What is new in FMI 3.0 [[fmi-whats-new]]
// TODO: here we need to reason and describe the new features, especially support for vECUs

=== Overview

The FMI (Functional Mock-up Interface) defines an interface to be implemented by an executable called an FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit).
The FMI functions are used (called) by a simulation environment to create one or more instances of the FMU and to simulate them, typically together with other models.
An FMU may either have its own solvers (FMI for Basic Co-Simulation, <<fmi-for-basic-co-simulation>> or FMI for Hybrid Co-Simulation, <<fmi-for-hybrid-co-simulation>>), or require the simulation environment to perform numerical integration (FMI for Model Exchange, <<fmi-for-model-exchange>>), or require the simulation environment to trigger model partition execution (FMI for Scheduled Co-Simulation , <<fmi-for-scheduled-co-simulation>>).
The goal of this interface is that the calling of an FMU in a simulation environment is reasonably simple.
This document does not describe how to generate an FMU from a modeling environment.

The FMI for Model Exchange interface defines an interface to the model of a dynamic system described by differential, algebraic and discrete-time equations.
It provides an interface to evaluate these equations as needed in different simulation environments, as well as in embedded control systems, with explicit or implicit integrators, and fixed or variable step-size.
The interface is designed to allow the description of large models.

The Co-Simulation interfaces are designed both for the coupling of simulation tools, and the coupling of subsystem models (which have been exported by their simulators together with its solvers as runnable code).
The modular structure of these systems is exploited in all stages of the simulation process beginning with the separate model setup and pre-processing for the individual subsystems in different simulation tools.
During time integration, the simulation is again performed independently for all subsystems restricting the data exchange between subsystems to discrete communication points.
Finally, the visualization and post-processing of simulation data can be done individually for each subsystem in its own native simulation tool or by the simulation environment.

The interfaces have large parts in common, defined in <<fmi-common-concepts>>.
In particular:

* FMI Application Programming Interface \(C) -- <<fmi-application-programming-interface>> +
All required equations or tool coupling computations are evaluated by calling standardized C functions.
C is used because it is the most portable programming language today and is the only programming language that can be utilized in all embedded control systems.

* FMI Description Schema (XML) -- <<fmi-description-schema>> +
The schema defines the structure and content of an XML file generated by a modeling environment.
This XML file contains the definition of all variables of the FMU in a standardized way.
It is then possible to run the C code in an embedded system without the overhead of the variable definition (the alternative would be to store this information in the C code and access it via function calls, but this is neither practical for embedded systems nor for large models).
Furthermore, the variable definition is a complex data structure and tools should be free to determine how to represent this data structure in their programs.
The selected approach allows a tool to store and access the variable definitions (without any memory or efficiency overhead of standardized access functions) in the programming language of the simulation environment.

* FMU Distribution (ZIP) -- <<fmu-distribution>> +
An FMU is distributed in one ZIP file.
The ZIP file contains the FMI Description file (XML), the binaries and libraries required to execute the FMI functions (.dll or .so files), the sources of the FMI functions (optional), and other data used by the FMU (e.g., tables or maps).
It is possible for an FMU to hide the source code to secure the contained know-how or to allow a fully automatic import of the FMU in another simulation environment.
A schematic view of an FMU is shown in <<figure-data-flow>>.

A growing set of tools supporting FMI can be found here https://www.fmi-standard.org/tools.

==== FMI for Model Exchange (ME)

The Model Exchange interface exposes an ODE to an external solver of an importing tool's master algorithm.
Models are described by differential, algebraic and discrete equations with time-, state- and step-events.
That master algorithm, usually a DAE solver, is responsible for advancing time, setting states, handling events, etc.
(See <<fmi-for-model-exchange>>.)

==== FMI for Basic Co-Simulation (BCS)

The intention is to provide a standardized interface for coupling of simulation models or tools in a co-simulation environment.
The data exchange between subsystems is largely restricted to discrete communication points.
In the time between two communication points, the subsystems are solved independently by internal means.
Master algorithms control the data exchange and the synchronization between subsystems (see <<fmi-for-basic-co-simulation>>).

Note that the master algorithm itself is not part of the FMI standard.

==== FMI for Hybrid Co-Simulation (HCS)

The Hybrid Co-Simulation interface adds a number of features primarily to allow for more sophisticated master algorithms that aim at more efficient and robust simulations.
Such additional features are raising events between communication time points using synchronous and asynchronous clocks or sharing values between communication points to allow for improved interpolation of data.
The master algorithm is responsible for:
* advancing the overall simulation time,
* triggering execution of synchronous and asynchronous external events for a set of FMUs, and
* handling events (e.g. clock ticks) signaled by the FMUs.

For both Basic Co-Simulation and Hybrid Co-Simulation the master algorithm is shielded from how the subsystem FMU advances time internally.
For example, FMUs containing ODEs and exposing either of the co-simulation interfaces require to include an ODE solver inside the FMU to internally advance time between the communication points.
As another example, for FMU that represent controller code, an internal scheduling algorithm will trigger tasks at the correct time and order while advancing time to the next communication point or event.
(See <<fmi-for-hybrid-co-simulation>>.)

==== FMI for Scheduled Co-Simulation (SCS)

The Scheduled Co-Simulation interface exposes individual parts of a model or tasks of a control algorithm, to be called by a master algorithm that acts as external scheduler.
The master algorithm is responsible for:
* advancing the overall simulation time,
* triggering execution of synchronous and asynchronous external events for all exposed model parts of a set of FMUs (e.g. tasks of a controller model), and
* handling events (e.g. clock ticks) signaled by the FMUs.

In many ways, the Scheduled Co-Simulation interface is the equivalent of the Model Exchange interface: the first externalizes a scheduling algorithm usually found in a controller algorithm and the second interface externalizes the ODE solver.
(See <<fmi-for-scheduled-co-simulation>>.)

=== Properties and Guiding Ideas

In this section, properties are listed and some principles are defined that guided the low-level design of the FMI.
This shall increase self consistency of the FMI functions.
The listed issues are sorted, starting from high-level properties to low-level implementation issues.

Expressivity::
The FMI provides the necessary features to package models of different domains, such as multibody and virtual ECUs, into an FMU.

Stability::
The FMI is expected to be supported by many simulation tools worldwide.
Implementing such support is a major investment for tool vendors.
Stability and backwards compatibility of the FMI has therefore high priority.
To support this, the FMI defines "capability flags" that will be used by future versions of the FMI to extend and improve the FMI in a backwards compatible way, whenever feasible.

Implementation::
FMUs can be written manually or can be generated automatically from a modeling environment.
Existing manually coded models can be transformed manually to a model according to the FMI standard.

Processor independence::
It is possible to distribute an FMU without knowing the target processor.
This allows an FMU to run on a PC, a Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation platform or as part of the controller software of an ECU.
Keeping the FMU independent of the target processor increases the usability of the FMU.
To be processor independent, the FMU must include its C (or C++) sources.

Simulator independence::
It is possible to compile, link and distribute an FMU without knowing the environment in which the FMU will be loaded.
Reason: The standard would be much less attractive otherwise, unnecessarily restricting the later use of an FMU at compile time and forcing users to maintain simulator specific variants of an FMU.
To be simulator independent, the FMU must export its implementation in self-contained binary form.
This requires that the target operating system and processor be known.
Once exported with binaries, the FMU can be executed by any simulator running on the target platform (provided the necessary licenses are available, if required from the model or from the used run-time libraries).

Small run-time overhead::
Communication between an FMU and a target simulator through the FMI does not introduce significant run-time overhead.
This can be achieved by enabling caching of the FMU outputs and by exchanging multiple quantities with one call.

Small footprint::
A compiled FMU binary requires little memory.
Reason: An FMU may run on an ECU (Electronic Control Unit, for example, a microprocessor), and ECUs have strong memory limitations.
This is achieved by storing signal attributes (`name`, `unit`, etc.) and all other static information not needed for model evaluation in a separate text file (= Model Description File) that is not needed on the microprocessor where the executable might run.

Hide data structure::
The FMI for Model Exchange does not prescribe a data structure (e.g., a C struct) to represent a model.
Reason: the FMI standard shall not unnecessarily restrict or prescribe a certain implementation of FMUs or simulators (whichever contains the model data) to ease implementation by different tool vendors.

Support many and nested FMUs::
A simulator may run many FMUs in a single simulation run and/or multiple instances of one FMU.
The inputs and outputs of these FMUs can be connected with direct feedthrough.
Moreover, an FMU may contain nested FMUs.

Numerical Robustness::
The FMI standard allows problems which are numerically critical (for example, time and state events, multiple sample rates, stiff problems) to be treated in a robust way.

Hide cache::
A typical FMU will cache computed results for later reuse.
To simplify usage and to reduce error possibilities by a simulator, the caching mechanism is hidden from the usage of the FMU.
Reason: First, the FMI should not force an FMU to implement a certain caching policy.
Second, this helps to keep the FMI simple.
To help implement this cache, the FMI provides explicit methods (called by the FMU environment) for setting properties that invalidate cached data.
An FMU that chooses to implement a cache may maintain a set of "dirty" flags, hidden from the simulator.
A get method, for example to a state, will then either trigger a computation, or return cached data, depending on the value of these flags.

Support numerical solvers::
A typical target simulator will use numerical solvers.
These solvers require vectors for <<state,`states`>>, <<derivative,`derivatives`>> and zero-crossing functions.
The FMU directly fills the values of such vectors provided by the solvers.
Reason: minimize execution time.
The exposure of these vectors conflicts somewhat with the "hide data structure" requirement, but the efficiency gain justifies this.

Explicit signature::
The intended operations, arguments, and return types are made explicit in the signature.
For example, an operator (such as `compute_derivatives`) is not passed as an int argument but a special function is called for this.
The `const` prefix is used for any pointer that should not be changed, including `const char*` instead of `char*`.
Reason: the correct use of the FMI can be checked at compile time and allows calling of the C code in a C++ environment (which is much stricter on `const` than C is).
This will help to develop FMUs that use the FMI in the intended way.

Few functions::
The FMI consists of a few, "orthogonal" functions, avoiding redundant functions that could be defined in terms of others.
Reason: This leads to a compact, easy-to-use, and hence attractive API with a compact documentation.

Error handling::
All FMI methods use a common set of methods to communicate errors.

Allocator must free::
All memory (and other resources) allocated by the FMU are freed (released) by the FMU.
Likewise, resources allocated by the target simulator are released by the target simulator.
Reason: this helps to prevent memory leaks and run-time errors due to incompatible run-time environments for different components.

Immutable strings::
All strings passed as arguments or returned are read-only and must not be modified by the receiver.
Reason: This eases the reuse of strings.

Named list elements::
All lists defined in the `fmi3ModelDescription.xsd` XML schema file have a string attribute `name` to a list element.
This attribute must be unique with respect to all other `name` attributes of the same list.

Use C::
The FMI is encoded using C, not C++.
Reasons: Avoid problems with compiler and linker dependent behavior, and run the FMU on embedded systems.

This version of the FMI standard does not have the following desirable properties.
They might be added in a future version.

* The FMI for Model Exchange is for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in state space form.
It is not for a general differential-algebraic equation system.
However, algebraic equation systems inside the FMU are supported (for example, the FMU can report to the environment to re-run the current step with a smaller step size since a solution could not be found for an algebraic equation system).

* Special features that might be useful for multibody system programs are not included.

* The interface is for simulation and for embedded systems.
Properties that might be additionally needed for trajectory optimization, for example, derivatives of the model with respect to parameters during continuous integration are not included.

* No explicit definition of the variable hierarchy in the XML file.

=== Conventions used in this Document

* Non-normative text is given in square brackets in italic font: _[Especially examples are defined in this style.]_

* Arrays appear in two forms:

** In the end-user/logical view, one- and two-dimensional arrays are used.
Here the convention of linear algebra, the control community and the most important tools in this area is utilized.
In other words the first element along one dimension starts at index one.
In all these cases, the starting index is also explicitly mentioned at the respective definition of the array.
For example, in the `modelDescription.xml` file, the set of exposed variables is defined as ordered sets where the first element is referenced with index one (these indices are, for example, used to define the sparseness structure of partial derivative matrices).

** In the implementation view, one-dimensional C arrays are used.
In order to access an array element the C convention is used.
For example, the first element of input argument `x` for function `setContinuousStates` is `x[0]`.

* The key words *MUST*, *MUST NOT*, *REQUIRED*, *SHALL*, *SHALL NOT*, *SHOULD*, *SHOULD NOT*, *RECOMMENDED*, *NOT RECOMMENDED*, *MAY*, and *OPTIONAL* in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

* `{VariableType}` is used as a placeholder for all variable type names without the `fmi3` prefix (e.g. `fmi3Get{VariableType}` stands for `fmi3GetUInt8`, `fmi3GetBoolean`, `fmi3GetFloat64`, etc.).

* State machine states be formatted in *bold*.
