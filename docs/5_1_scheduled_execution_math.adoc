=== Mathematical Description [[math-scheduled-execution]]

The Scheduled Execution interface has a different timing concept compared to FMI for Co-Simulation.
This is required to cover <<clock>> ticks for <<periodic,aperiodic>> <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> which may tick at time instances that are not predictable in advance for the simulation algorithm.
Typically, hardware I/O or virtual ECU software events belong to this category.

A simulation algorithm's call for computing a model partition will compute the results of the model partition defined by an <<inputClock>> for the current <<clock>> tick time latexmath:[t_i].

The result values will be computed for the current <<clock>> tick time (activation time) latexmath:[t_i] from the assigned <<inputClock>> (which is known to the simulation algorithm).
Refer to the <<clock>> time progress definition (<<CommunicationPointClocks>>) for <<periodic>> <<clock,`clocks`>>.

If required, the FMU can internally derive the <<clock>> interval latexmath:[\Delta T_i] based on the last <<clock>> tick time latexmath:[t_{i-1}] i.e. last activation time for this model partition.

A model partition can only be activated once per activation time point latexmath:[t_i].

Model partitions that are associated to <<outputClock,`output clocks`>> will accordingly provide the result values of the model partition's variables for the current <<outputClock>> tick time latexmath:[t_i] of the active <<outputClock>>.
The activation of such an <<outputClock>> is not controlled by the simulation algorithm but internally by the FMU.

More details can be found in <<operation-on-clocks>>, specifically <<CommunicationPointClocks>>.
