=== Mathematical Description [[math-scheduled-execution]]

The Scheduled Execution interface has a different timing concept compared to FMI for Co-Simulation.
This is required to cover <<clock>> ticks for <<periodic,aperiodic>> <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> which may tick at time instances that are not predictable in advance for the simulation algorithm.
Typically, hardware I/O or virtual ECU software events belong to this category.

A simulation algorithm's call for computing a model partition will compute the results of the model partition defined by an <<inputClock>> for the current <<clock>> tick time latexmath:[t_i].

The result values will be computed for the current <<clock>> tick time (activation time) latexmath:[t_i] from the assigned <<inputClock>> (which is known to the simulation algorithm).
Refer to the <<clock>> time progress definition (<<clock-types-for-evaluation-of-clocked-model-partitions>>) for <<periodic>> <<clock,`clocks`>>.

If required, the FMU can internally derive the <<clock>> interval latexmath:[\Delta T_i] based on the last <<clock>> tick time latexmath:[t_{i-1}] i.e. last activation time for this model partition.

A model partition can only be activated once per activation time point latexmath:[t_i].

Model partitions that are associated to <<outputClock,`output clocks`>> will accordingly provide the result values of the model partition's variables for the current <<outputClock>> tick time latexmath:[t_i] of the active <<outputClock>>.
The activation of such an <<outputClock>> is not controlled by the simulation algorithm but internally by the FMU.

==== Communication Point Clocks [[clock-types-for-evaluation-of-clocked-model-partitions]]

Communication Point Clocks, introduced here, are used only in Co-Simulation and Scheduled Execution to define the communication points of model partitions (defined below).
These <<clock,`clocks`>> are not compatible with synchronous clocks theory and must not be used together with synchronous clocks in one model.

A model partition is mathematically defined as:

[latexmath]
++++
x_j=f_j(x_{j-1},u_j,t_j)
++++

[latexmath]
++++
y_j=g_j(x_{j-1},u_j,t_j)
++++

Communication Point Clocks can also be defined for continuous or piecewise continuous parts of the model.

===== Clock Priority

The <<clock,`clocks`>> are ordered descending based on their priorities.
It is nevertheless possible to define multiple <<clock,`clocks`>> with the same priority.
No ordering is defined for <<clock,`clocks`>> of the same priority.
If a computational order information is needed, different priorities for <<clock,`clocks`>> have to be defined.
The priority of a <<clock>> has to be defined in the <<modelDescription.xml>> via the <<clock>> variable integer attribute `priority` - smaller values have a higher priority.

_[For <<periodic>> <<clock,`clocks`>> it is recommended to derive the priorities based on a rate monotonic scheduling scheme (smallest period leads to highest priority, that is, has the smallest priority value.]_

_[The clock priorities are local to an FMU.
It is not possible for an FMU exporting tool to know in advance the priorities of other FMUs that will be connected to an FMU in a simulation setup.
It is the task of the simulation algorithm to derive a computational order for the computation of two or more distinct FMUs based on the local FMU clock priorities and input-output relationships of connected FMUs.]_

_[For real-time computation use cases (e.g., in Scheduled Execution), the priority information is used also for task preemption configurations.
It is therefore important to restrict the number of distinct priority levels for an FMU to available priority levels on the target platform and/or to avoid unnecessary computational overhead.
A common number of different priority levels is, e.g., 100 (0 to 99), as defined in Linux based operating systems.]_

===== Clock Relationships [[clock-relationships-for-communication-point-clocks]]

If <<outputClock,`output clocks`>> and <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> are defined, it is possible to define a tick relationship from an <<outputClock>> to an <<inputClock>>.
This is needed to allow for an external scheduler to achieve an optimal control of model partitions.
The <<outputClock,`output clocks`>> and the associated <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> define a union of <<clock,`clocks`>>.
In that sense, if an <<outputClock>> ticks the associated <<inputClock>> ticks at the same time instant in such a union.
It is only meaningful to combine an <<outputClock,`output clock`>> with an <<periodic,aperiodic>> <<inputClock>> in such a union.
It is possible to define multiple unions of <<clock,`clocks`>>, with the maximum number defined by the number of available <<periodic,aperiodic>> <<inputClock,`input clocks`>>, i.e. each <<inputClock,`input clock`>> may be contained at most in one union of clocks.
