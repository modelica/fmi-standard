==== Activating Model Partitions

In Scheduled Execution the importer has to ensure that model partitions are scheduled according to their activation time and priorities.
This is realized in <<ClockActivationMode>> by calling <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> triggering their respective Clocks.

After <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> has been called for a <<calculated>>, <<tunable>> or <<changing-aperiodic-clock>> Clock the FMU provides the information on when the Clock will tick again, i.e. when the corresponding model partition must be scheduled the next time.
To retrieve this information the importer calls <<fmi3GetInterval>> on the Clock.

The FMU may request to schedule another model partition even while currently a model partition is being executed.

A new interval for a <<countdown-aperiodic-clock,`countdown`>> Clock can be provided at any time during the execution of any model partition.
The FMU signals that a <<countdown-aperiodic-clock,`countdown`>> Clock is about to tick by calling <<fmi3ClockUpdateCallback>>.
The importer calls <<fmi3GetInterval>> for all <<countdown-aperiodic-clock,`countdown`>> Clocks.
If a new interval latexmath:[\mathbf{T}_{interval, i}] is provided, i.e. return argument <<qualifiers>> = <<fmi3IntervalChanged>>, the importer initiates the scheduling of the associated model partitions regarding the delay of the returned interval.

In case more than one Clock ticks at the same time instant, the scheduler needs a priority to define the activation sequence of the associated model partitions.
This ordering is defined by the <<priority>> attributes of the Clock.
For Scheduled Execution this attribute is mandatory for every Clock.

_[A clock's <<priority>> information is required to support the scheduled execution of several model partitions._
_In particular the <<preemption-support, preemption support>> is based these priorities._
_It is therefore important to restrict the number of distinct priority levels for an FMU to available priority levels on the target platform and/or to avoid unnecessary computational overhead._
_A common number of different priority levels is, e.g., 100 (0 to 99), as defined in Linux based operating systems.]_

_[The Clock priorities are local to an FMU._
_It is not possible for an FMU exporting tool to know in advance the priorities of other FMUs that will be connected to an FMU in a simulation setup._
_It is the responsibility of the importer to derive a computational order for the computation of two or more distinct FMUs based on the local FMU Clock priorities and input-output relationships of connected FMUs.]_

_[For <<periodic-clock, `periodic Clocks`>> it is recommended to derive the priorities based on a rate monotonic scheduling scheme (smallest period leads to highest priority, that is, has the smallest priority value.]_

==== Preemption Support [[preemption-support]]

If a model partition of lower <<priority>> is executed when a model partition of higher priority is activated the scheduler must ensure that the execution of the latter one is not delayed and causing violations of timing constraints.
_[On a real-time simulator a violation of a timing constraint usually results in an overrun exception i.e. a model partition is supposed to be executed when an instance of the same model partition has not yet finished its execution.]_

Preemption support means that the scheduler can immediately interrupt the current execution of a model partition in order to execute a model partition of higher priority.
The computation of the interrupted model partition is proceeded afterwards.
So by regarding priorities and supporting preemption the scheduler can ensure that most critical model partitions are never delayed by less important model parts.
_[This is particularly important for real-time simulators as the wall clock time is dictating the time for the next execution.]_

* Same <<priority>>: The scheduler does not preempt the execution of a model partition in favor of a model partition of the same priority.
For model partitions with the same priority, it decides on the execution order based on (customer) configurations in the importer.
* Different priorities: The scheduler preempts the execution of a model partition of a lower priority as soon as a model partition of higher priority partition needs to be computed.
_[Simply stated: The model partition of higher priority preempts the model partition of lower priority.]_

_[An example for scheduling based on priorities and preempting model partitions is given in section <<example-scheduled-execution>>.]_

It may be important for the FMU to secure particular sections of its code against being preempted.
Callback functions <<preemption-support,`fmi3LockPreemptionCallback`>> and <<preemption-support,`fmi3UnlockPreemptionCallback`>> are provided by the simulation algorithm when instantiating the FMU via <<fmi3InstantiateScheduledExecution>> to allow the FMU to signal entering and exiting such code sections.

The FMU's code has to be prepared to correctly handle preemption of

* <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>>,
* <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>>,
* <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Set{VariableType}`>>,
* <<fmi3GetClock>>
* and <<fmi3GetIntervalDecimal>>.

In general this means that the FMU's code has to secure access to its global states and variables wherever data inconsistencies due to potential preemptions are anticipated.

_[Note that_

* _in order to avoid data inconsistencies and safeguard predictable behavior with <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>>, <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Set{VariableType}`>> a unique assignment of the respective variables to model partitions via its associated <<Clock>> is strongly recommended._
_Observe the example below:_
_If every variable is assigned uniquely to a model partition it is not necessary to use <<preemption-support, `preemption locks`>> in the context of <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>> and <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Set{VariableType}`>>._
* _for <<fmi3GetClock>> the FMU has to ensure that the active state of an <<outputClock,output Clock>> is securely reset and cannot be observed twice for the same Clock tick in case this call is preempted._
_An example is given in <<example-scheduled-execution>>._
* _for <<fmi3GetIntervalDecimal>> the FMU has to ensure that the <<countdown-aperiodic-clock, countdown Clock's>> interval qualifier is reset to <<fmi3GetIntervalDecimal, `fmi3IntervalUnchanged`>> and cannot be observed twice for the same Clock tick in case this call is preempted._
_An example is given in <<example-scheduled-execution>>._
* _depending on their implementation <<preemption-support,`fmi3CallbackLockPreemption`>> and <<preemption-support,`fmi3CallbackUnlockPreemption`>> have a strong impact on the simulator's operating system so their use should be as rare and short as possible._
_So in general it is recommended to reduce dependencies between different model partitions of one FMU by design._
_One may also consider if the code can be preempted by other parts of the same FMU: E.g. a model partition cannot be interrupted if it is the only model partition of the FMU or if it holds the highest priority._
_I such cases no locks are necessary.]_

_[Example to observe why every variable should be assigned uniquely to a model partition via its associated <<Clock>>:_

* _An output variable is changed by two different model partitions._
_The values returned by <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>> that is placed after <<fmi3ActivateModelPartition>> may return the values computed by the other model partition if that model partition has higher priority and preempted the execution meanwhile._
* _An input variable is used by two different model partitions._
_The variable values of a model partitions of lower priority may have been overwritten by a call to <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Set{VariableType}`>> for a model partition of higher priority.]_
