=== State Machine and Semantics [[common-state-machine]]

To define allowed calling sequences of FMI functions, state machines are used.
Each state of the state machine corresponds to a certain phase of a simulation.
All FMI interface types share a number of states in their respective state machines.
This chapter describes these common states used in at least two of the interface types.
State-machine states specific to a single FMI interface type will be described in their respective chapters.

[[each-state-description]]
Each state description lists the governing equations and actions and the corresponding API functions influencing these equations in a table (not defining the calling order), and also lists the allowed function calls and usage restrictions.

.Common calling sequence for C functions of common states for all three FMI types.
[#figure-common-state-machine]
image::images/state-machines-common-states.svg[width=80%, align="center"]

The state machine is given here as UML 2.0 state machine.
If a transition is labeled with one or more function names (for example, <<fmi3EnterInitializationMode>>, <<fmi3EnterEventMode>>), the transition is taken if the function call returns successfully (not `NULL` for <<fmi3Instantiate>> or <<fmi3OK>> and <<fmi3Warning>> for all other functions).
This way, importer and FMU can determine in which state the FMU is.

==== Super State: FMU State Setable [[FMUStateSetable,*FMU State Setable*]]

The state <<FMUStateSetable>> is entered when any of the following functions is called: <<fmi3InstantiateModelExchange>>, <<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> and <<fmi3InstantiateScheduledExecution>>.
The state is left by either calling <<fmi3FreeInstance>> or when any of the functions called during <<FMUStateSetable>> returns <<fmi3Fatal>>.
If any function called in super state <<FMUStateSetable>> returns <<fmi3Error>>, the FMU enters state <<Terminated>>.

Allowed Function Calls to enter this Super State::

[[fmi3InstantiateModelExchange,`fmi3InstantiateModelExchange`]]
Function `fmi3InstantiateModelExchange`::
This function instantiates a Model Exchange FMU (see <<fmi-for-model-exchange>>).
It is allowed to call this function only if <<modelDescription.xml>> includes a `<ModelExchange>` element.

[[fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation,`fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation`]]
Function `fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation`::
This function instantiates a Co-Simulation FMU (see <<fmi-for-co-simulation>>).
It is allowed to call this function only if <<modelDescription.xml>> includes a `<CoSimulation>` element.

[[fmi3InstantiateScheduledExecution,`fmi3InstantiateScheduledExecution`]]
Function `fmi3InstantiateScheduledExecution`::
This function instantiates a Scheduled Execution FMU (see <<fmi-for-scheduled-execution>>).
It is allowed to call this function only if <<modelDescription.xml>> includes a `<ScheduledExecution>` element.
+
[[fmi3Instantiate,`fmi3InstantiateXXX`]]
[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=Instantiate]
----

+
These functions return a new instance of an FMU with the respective interface type.
If a null pointer is returned, then instantiation failed.
In that case, <<logMessage>> is called with detailed information about the reason.
An FMU can be instantiated many times (provided capability flag `canBeInstantiatedOnlyOncePerProcess = false`).

+
The arguments of the instantiation functions are detailed as follows:

* `instanceName` is a unique identifier for the FMU instance.
It is used to name the instance, for example, in error or information messages generated by one of the `fmi3XXX` functions.
The argument `instanceName` must be a non empty string (in other words, must have at least one character that is not a white space).
_[If only one FMU is simulated, as `instanceName` attribute `modelName` or `<ModelExchange|CoSimulation|ScheduledExecution modelIdentifier="..">` from the XML schema `fmi3ModelDescription` might be used.]_

* <<instantiationToken>> can be used by the FMU to check that the <<modelDescription.xml>> file (see <<fmu-distribution>>) is compatible with the implementation of the FMU.
It is an opaque string generated by the FMU exporter that is stored in the xml file as mandatory attribute <<instantiationToken>> (see <<fmiModelDescription>>).
It must be passed unchanged to the FMU.
This argument must not be a null pointer.

* [[resourceLocation,`resourceLocation`]] `resourceLocation` is a URI according to the http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3986/[IETF RFC3986] syntax to indicate the location to the `resources` directory of the unzipped FMU archive.
The following schemes must be understood by the FMU:

** Mandatory -- `file` with absolute path (either including or omitting the authority component); +
** Optional -- `http`, `https`, `ftp`.

+
_[Example: An FMU is unzipped in directory `C:\temp\MyFMU`, then <<resourceLocation>> = `file:///C:/temp/MyFMU/resources` or `file:/C:/temp/MyFMU/resources`._ +
_The <<fmi3Instantiate>> functions are then able to read all needed resources from this directory, for example maps or tables used by the FMU.]_ +
A NULL pointer is supplied for <<resourceLocation>>, if no resource location can be provided to the FMU, which may occur

** if the FMU does not contain a resources folder, or
** if the environment is not able to provide an URI to the resources folder _[e.g., if the environment does not have a file system._
_If the FMU in such a case cannot be simulated, as it depends on the resources folder, it shall terminate with an error.]_


* `visible == fmi3False` defines that the interaction with the user should be reduced to a minimum (no application window, no plotting, no animation, etc.).
In other words, the FMU is executed in batch mode.
If `visible == fmi3True`, the FMU is executed in interactive mode, and the FMU might require to explicitly acknowledge start of simulation / instantiation / initialization (acknowledgment is non-blocking).

* If `loggingOn == fmi3False`, then any logging is disabled and the <<logMessage>> callback function is not called by the FMU.
If `loggingOn == fmi3True`, the FMU enables a vendor defined set of `<LogCategories>`.
This set should typically contain categories for messages that explain execution errors, like <<fmi3Discard>>, <<fmi3Error>> and <<fmi3Fatal>>.
The function <<fmi3SetDebugLogging>> gives more detailed control about required `<LogCategories>` (see <<definition-of-log-categories>>).


+
* [[eventModeUsed,`eventModeUsed`]]If `eventModeUsed == fmi3True` the importer can handle events, otherwise <<fmi3EnterEventMode>> must not be called.
The flag may only be `fmi3True`, if <<hasEventMode,`hasEventMode == true`>>, otherwise the FMU must raise an error.
For FMUs that have clocks, `eventModeUsed == fmi3True` is required.

* [[earlyReturnAllowed,`earlyReturnAllowed`]]If `earlyReturnAllowed == fmi3True` the importer can handle <<early-return,early return>>.
Only in this case, <<fmi3DoStep>> may return with <<earlyReturn,`earlyReturn == fmi3True`>>.

* `instanceEnvironment` is a pointer that can be passed to the <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> function in order that the simulation environment can provide an efficient way to identify the FMU that called <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>>.

* [[requiredIntermediateVariables,`requiredIntermediateVariables`]] `requiredIntermediateVariables` is an array of the value references of all <<input>> variables that the simulation algorithm intends to set and all <<output>> variables it intends to get during intermediate updates.
This set may be empty (<<nRequiredIntermediateVariables>> == 0) when the simulation algorithm does not intend to use intermediate update.
Only the variables in <<requiredIntermediateVariables>> may be accessed by the simulation algorithm using <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Set{VariableType}`>> and <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>> during <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> callbacks.
All variables referenced in this set must be marked with the attribute <<intermediateUpdate,`intermediateUpdate = "true"`>> in the model description.
For Co-Simulation, these intermediate variables must be continuous-time variables.

* [[nRequiredIntermediateVariables,`nRequiredIntermediateVariables`]] `nRequiredIntermediateVariables` gives the number of entries in <<requiredIntermediateVariables>>.
If <<nRequiredIntermediateVariables>> is zero <<requiredIntermediateVariables>> is not defined.

* [[logMessage,`logMessage`]]Callback function `logMessage`
+
[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=CallbackLogMessage]
----
+
Pointer to a function that is called in the FMU _[usually if an `fmi3XXX` function does not behave as desired]_.

** `instanceName` is the instance name of the model that calls this function.
** `status` contains the severity of the message, see `fmi3Status`.
If <<logMessage>> is called with <<fmi3OK,`status == fmi3OK`>>, then the message is a pure information message.
** `category` is the category of the message.
The meaning of `category` is defined by the modeling environment that generated the FMU.
Depending on this modeling environment, none, some, or all, allowed values of `category` for this FMU are defined in the <<modelDescription.xml>> file via element `<fmiModelDescription><LogCategories>`, see <<definition-of-log-categories>>.
Only messages are provided by function <<logMessage>> that have a category according to a call to <<fmi3SetDebugLogging>>.
** `message` is a string that contains the message.

+
All string-valued arguments passed by the FMU to the <<logMessage>> may be deallocated by the FMU directly after function <<logMessage>> returns.
The simulation environment must therefore create copies of these strings if it needs to access these strings later. +
The <<logMessage>> function will append a line break to each message when writing messages after each other to a terminal or a file (the messages may also be shown in other ways, for example, as separate text-boxes in a GUI).
The caller may include line-breaks (using "\n") within the message, but should avoid trailing line breaks. +
Variables can be referenced in a message with `pass:[#]<ValueReference>pass:[#]`.
If the character `pass:[#]` shall be included in the message, it has to be prefixed with `pass:[#]`, so `pass:[#]` is an escape character. +
_[Example: The message `\#1365# must be larger than zero (used in IO channel ##4)` might be changed by the <<logMessage>> function to `body.m must be larger than zero (used in IO channel #4)` if `body.m` is the name of the variable with value reference 1365.]_

* Callback function `intermediateUpdate` +
See <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> for details.

* Callback function `lockPreemption` and `unlockPreemption` +
See <<preemption-support>> for details.

+
The arguments <<logMessage>>, <<intermediateUpdate>>, <<preemption-support,`lockPreemption`>>, and <<preemption-support,`unlockPreemption`>>, are function pointers provided by the simulation environment to be used by the FMU.
It is not allowed to change these functions between <<fmi3Instantiate>> and <<fmi3Terminate>> calls.
Additionally, a pointer to the environment is provided (`instanceEnvironment`) that needs to be passed to all of the callback functions, in order that those functions can utilize data from the environment, such as mapping a <<valueReference>> to a string, or assigning memory to a certain FMU instance.

Allowed Function Calls::

[[fmi3SetDebugLogging,`fmi3SetDebugLogging`]]Function `fmi3SetDebugLogging`::
+
[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=SetDebugLogging]
----
The function controls debug logging that is output via the <<logMessage>> callback function.

** If `loggingOn == fmi3True`, debug logging is enabled, otherwise it is switched off.
** `nCategories` defines the length of the next argument `categories`
If `loggingOn == fmi3True` and `nCategories == 0`, then all debug messages shall be output.
If `loggingOn == fmi3True` and `nCategories > 0`, then only debug messages according to the `categories` argument shall be printed via the <<logMessage>> function.
** `categories` is a vector with `nCategories` elements.
The allowed values of `categories` are defined by the modeling environment that generated the FMU.
Depending on the generating modeling environment, none, some or all allowed values for `categories` for this FMU are defined in the <<modelDescription.xml>> file via element `<fmiModelDescription><LogCategories>`, see <<definition-of-log-categories>>.

[[fmi3Reset,`fmi3Reset`]]Function `fmi3Reset`::
+
[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=Reset]
----
+
Is called by the environment to reset the FMU after a simulation run.
The FMU goes into the same state as if <<fmi3Instantiate>> would have been called.
All variables have their default values.
Before starting a new run <<fmi3EnterInitializationMode>> has to be called.

[[fmi3FreeInstance,`fmi3FreeInstance`]]
Function `fmi3FreeInstance`::
+
[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=FreeInstance]
----
+
Disposes the given instance, unloads the loaded model, and frees all the allocated memory and other resources that have been allocated by the functions of the FMU interface.
If a null pointer is provided for argument `instance`, the function call is ignored (does not have an effect).

Function <<fmi3GetFMUState>>::
Function <<fmi3SetFMUState>>::
Function <<fmi3FreeFMUState>>::
Function <<fmi3SerializedFMUStateSize>>::
Function <<fmi3SerializeFMUState>>::
Function <<fmi3DeSerializeFMUState>>::
All these allowed functions are described in <<get-set-fmu-state>>.

==== State: Instantiated [[Instantiated,*Instantiated*]]

In the state <<Instantiated>> the FMU can do one-time initializations and allocate memory.

This function can only be called in Model Exchange.

* Argument `nContinuousStates` points to the `size_t` variable that will receive the number of <<state,states>>.

+
The number of <<state,continuous states>> might change if a variable representing a state has a `<Dimension>` element that references a <<structuralParameter,`structural parameter`>> (see <<ConfigurationMode>> and <<ReconfigurationMode>>).
<<fmi3GetNumberOfContinuousStates>> must be called after such <<structuralParameter,`structural parameters`>> changed.

The number of <<state-event,event indicators>> might change if a variable related to <<state-event,event indicators>> has a `<Dimension>` that references a <<structuralParameter,`structural parameter`>>  (see <<ConfigurationMode>> and <<ReconfigurationMode>>).
<<fmi3GetNumberOfEventIndicators>> must be called after such <<structuralParameter,`structural parameters`>> changed.
As long as no <<structuralParameter,`structural parameters`>> changed, the number of event indicators is given in the <<modelDescription.xml>>, alleviating the need to call this function.

Function `fmi3EnterInitializationMode`::
+
[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tags=EnterInitializationMode]
----
+
Changes state to <<InitializationMode>>.

* [[toleranceDefined,`toleranceDefined`]]`toleranceDefined` and
* [[tolerance,`tolerance`]]`tolerance` depend on the interface type:

** Model Exchange: If <<toleranceDefined,`toleranceDefined == fmi3True`>>, then the model is called with a numerical integration scheme where the step size is controlled by using <<tolerance>> for error estimation (usually as relative tolerance).
In such a case all numerical algorithms used inside the model (for example, to solve non-linear algebraic equations) should also operate with an error estimation of an appropriate smaller relative tolerance.

** Co-Simulation: If <<toleranceDefined,`toleranceDefined == fmi3True`>>, then the communication step size of the FMU is controlled by error estimation.
In case the FMU utilizes a numerical integrator with variable step size and error estimation, it is suggested to use <<tolerance>> for the error estimation of the integrator (usually as relative tolerance). +
An FMU for Co-Simulation might ignore this argument.


* [[startTime,`startTime`]]`startTime` and
* [[stopTime,`stopTime`]]`stopTime` can be used to check whether the model is valid within the given boundaries, or to allocate the necessary memory for storing results.
<<startTime>> is the <<fixed>> <<initial>> value of the <<independent>> variable and inherits its unit.
+
_[It is defined with <<causality>> = <<independent>> in the <<modelDescription.xml>>._
_If the <<independent>> variable is `time`, <<startTime>> is the starting time of initialization.]_

* [[stopTimeDefined,`stopTimeDefined`]] If `stopTimeDefined == fmi3True`, then <<stopTime>> is the final value of the <<independent>> variable and inherits its unit.
If the environment tries to compute past <<stopTime>>, the FMU has to return <<fmi3Error,`fmi3Status == fmi3Error`>>.
If <<stopTimeDefined,`stopTimeDefined == fmi3False`>>, then no final value of the <<independent>> variable is defined and argument <<stopTime>> is meaningless.

==== State: Initialization Mode [[InitializationMode,*Initialization Mode*]]

The <<InitializationMode>> is used by the simulation algorithm to compute consistent initial conditions for the overall system.
Equations are active to determine the initial FMU state, as well as all <<output,`outputs`>> (and optionally other variables exposed by the exporting tool).
Artificial or real algebraic loops over connected FMUs in <<InitializationMode>> may be handled by using appropriate numerical algorithms.

In <<InitializationMode>>, the FMU computes initial values at the start time latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_\mathit{start}] using function latexmath:[\mathbf{f}_\mathit{init}], not present in the other modes, for example, equations to define the <<start>> value for a <<state>> or for the derivative of a <<state>>.

Return the nominal values of the continuous <<state,`states`>>.
This function can only be called in Model Exchange.

* Return argument `nominals` contains the nominal values for each <<state,continuous state>> with the same convention for the order as defined for <<fmi3SetContinuousStates>>.
If the FMU does not have information about the nominal value of a continuous <<state>> `i`, a nominal value `nominals[i] == 1.0` should be returned.
It is required that `nominals[i] > 0.0`.

* Argument `nContinuousStates` is the size of the `nominals` vector.

+
This function should always be called after calling function <<fmi3UpdateDiscreteStates>>, if `nominalsOfContinuousStatesChanged == fmi3True`, since then the nominal values of the continuous <<state,`states`>> have changed _[for example, because the mapping of the continuous <<state,`states`>> to variables has changed because of internal <<dynamic-state-selection>>]_.

Only <<time-based-clocks,Time-based clocks>> must not be active for more than one call of <<fmi3UpdateDiscreteStates>> per <<EventMode>>.

For <<countdown-aperiodic-clocks>>, these functions must be called in every <<EventMode>>. +
Clock intervals are computed in <<fmi3UpdateDiscreteStates>> (at the latest), therefore, these functions should be called after <<fmi3UpdateDiscreteStates>>.

==== State: Intermediate Update Mode [[IntermediateUpdateMode,*Intermediate Update Mode*]]

This state is only available in Co-Simulation and Scheduled Execution.

_[The following use cases are enabled:_

* _Access to intermediate variables enables advanced Co-Simulation with interpolation/extrapolation techniques (such as polynomial extrapolation, Transmission Line Modeling (TLM) co-simulation, anti-alias filtering, smoothing of input among others)._
* _<<IntermediateUpdateMode>> enables the same input approximation that was possible in FMI 2.0 with `fmi2SetInputDerivatives`, by evaluation of the approximation polynomial by the importer and not within the FMU as in FMI 2.0_
* _FMUs can inform the importer about an event, which occurs during an <<fmi3DoStep>> in case of CS (see <<fmi-for-co-simulation>>)._
* _The Co-Simulation algorithm can request an <<early-return,early return>> from <<fmi3DoStep>>, because of an event between communication points (see <<early-return>>)._
* _A model partition of a Scheduled Execution FMU calls <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> to signal clock activations with `clocksTicked == fmi3True`._

_Note that the call to <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> and thus entering the <<IntermediateUpdateMode>> can only be triggered by the FMU itself._
_The importer cannot actively trigger this and hence for some use cases (e.g. cooperative multitasking and setting of intermediate input values) it relies on the callbacks from the FMUs to be able to realize these use cases properly.]_

A Co-Simulation FMU can provide values for its <<output>> variables at intermediate points between two consecutive communication points, and is able to receive new values for <<input>> variables at these intermediate points.
This is typically required when the FMU uses a numerical solver to integrate the FMU's internal state between communication points in <<fmi3DoStep>>.
This numerical solver assumes that the inputs are continuous in the integration interval, dictated by <<fmi3DoStep>>.
In FMI 2.0 Co-simulation, the intermediate inputs are provided by the use of extrapolations.
The intermediate update functions allow FMUs to receive inputs, and provide outputs, directly to the co-simulation algorithm, in those intermediate time points.

Intermediate values for <<continuous>> inputs are computed by the importer for example by an extrapolation polynomial build with the output derivatives of connected FMUs.
FMUs can signal with the optional attribute <<recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness>> of value latexmath:[k] to the co-simulation algorithm that best convergence rates can be achieved if these approximation functions are of smoothness latexmath:[C^{k}([\mathbf{t}_i, \mathbf{t}_{i+1}\])], that is k-time continuously differentiable, with latexmath:[C^{0}] meaning continuous. +
_[This can increase simulation speed for higher order multi-step solvers that in this case do not have to reset at communication points.]_

The importer must ensure that the input approximation function latexmath:[\mathbf{u}_u] is consistent with the values of the input variable (latexmath:[\mathbf{u}_u(\mathbf{t}_{i+1})= \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{t}_{i+1})]).

// TODO: Irina/Matthias: what is <<IntermediateUpdateMode>> used for in Scheduled Execution: Please provide small paragraph like previous paragraph

Due to the way numerical solvers estimate and correct the approximation error, these intermediate <<output>> values may be tentative or may be final.
It is possible for the FMU to inform the co-simulation algorithm whether the internal solver is in a tentative state, meaning that the output values computed from that state are also tentative, or if the internal solver has successfully completed the integration step, meaning that the FMU's internal state is final, and will never be changed in the current execution of <<fmi3DoStep>>.
If the internal integration step has been successfully completed, the co-simulation algorithm can forward intermediate outputs to other FMUs, where they can be used, for e.g., for extrapolation, interpolation, filtering or asynchronous co-simulation.

<<figure-IntermediateUpdateMode>> summarizes the above description.
It illustrates multiple intermediate internal solver steps, distinguishing between the final ones (with black-filled circles) and tentative ones (with white-filled circles).
It distinguishes the level of trust that can be placed in the tentative outputs (with dashed arrows) and in final outputs (with solid arrows).

.Overview of solver states and intermediate update during a communication step
[#figure-IntermediateUpdateMode]
image::images/intermediateupdate.svg[width=65%, align="center"]

The FMU signals the support of <<IntermediateUpdateMode>> via the capability flag <<providesIntermediateUpdate>>.
The co-simulation algorithm signals the support for <<IntermediateUpdateMode>> by providing a non-NULL callback-function pointer for <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate, `intermediateUpdate`>>.

The FMU enters <<IntermediateUpdateMode>> by calling <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> within <<StepMode>> (CS) or <<ClockActivationMode>> (SE) and leaves the state towards <<StepMode>> (CS) or <<ClockActivationMode>> (SE) when the function returns.

[[fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate,`fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate`]]
[source, C]
----
include::../headers/fmi3FunctionTypes.h[tag=CallbackIntermediateUpdate]
----

[[intermediateUpdateTime,`intermediateUpdateTime`]]
* <<intermediateUpdateTime>> is the internal value of the <<independent>> variable _[typically simulation time]_ of the FMU at which the callback has been called for intermediate and final steps.
If an event happens or an <<outputClock>> ticks, <<intermediateUpdateTime>> is the time of event or <<outputClock>> tick.
In Co-Simulation, <<intermediateUpdateTime>> is restricted by the arguments to <<fmi3DoStep>> as follows: +
<<currentCommunicationPoint>> latexmath:[\leq] <<intermediateUpdateTime>> latexmath:[\leq] (<<currentCommunicationPoint>> + <<communicationStepSize>>). +
The FMU must not call the callback function <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> with an <<intermediateUpdateTime>> that is smaller than the <<intermediateUpdateTime>> given in a previous call of <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>> with `intermediateStepFinished == fmi3True`.
In Scheduled Execution the <<intermediateUpdateTime>> should be ignored since in this case the simulation algorithm controls the time and not the FMU.

[[clocksTicked,`clocksTicked`]]
* The <<clocksTicked>> parameter is only used in Scheduled Execution and is ignored in Co-Simulation.
When <<clocksTicked,`clocksTicked == fmi3True`>>, it means that <<fmi3GetClock>> function must be called for gathering all <<clock>> related information about ticking <<outputClock,`output clocks`>> and then activate the given model partitions accordingly.

[[intermediateVariableSetRequested,`intermediateVariableSetRequested`]]
* If <<intermediateVariableSetRequested,`intermediateVariableSetRequested == fmi3True`>>, the co-simulation algorithm may provide intermediate values for continuous <<input>> variables with <<intermediateUpdate,`intermediateUpdate = true`>> by calling <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Set{VariableType}`>>.
The set of variables for which the co-simulation algorithm will provide intermediate values is declared through the <<requiredIntermediateVariables>> argument to <<fmi3Instantiate>>.
If a co-simulation algorithm does not provide a new value for any of the variables contained in the set it registered, the last value set remains.

[[intermediateVariableGetAllowed,`intermediateVariableGetAllowed`]]
* If <<intermediateVariableGetAllowed,`intermediateVariableGetAllowed == fmi3True`>>, the co-simulation algorithm may collect intermediate output variables by calling <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>> for variables with <<intermediateUpdate,`intermediateUpdate = true`>>.
The set of variables for which the co-simulation algorithm can get values is supplied through the <<requiredIntermediateVariables>> argument to <<fmi3Instantiate>>.

[[intermediateStepFinished,`intermediateStepFinished`]]
* If <<intermediateStepFinished, `intermediateStepFinished == fmi3False`>>, the intermediate outputs of the FMU that the co-simulation algorithm inquires with <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>> resulting from tentative internal solver states and may still change for the same <<intermediateUpdateTime>> _[e.g., if the solver deems the tentative state to cause a too high approximation error, it may go back in time and try to re-estimate the state using smaller internal time steps]_. +
If <<intermediateStepFinished, `intermediateStepFinished == fmi3True`>>, intermediate outputs inquired by the co-simulation algorithm with <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>> correspond to accepted internal solver step.

[[canReturnEarly,`canReturnEarly`]]
* When <<canReturnEarly,`canReturnEarly == fmi3True`>> the FMU signals to the co-simulation algorithm its ability to return early from the current <<fmi3DoStep>>. +
This argument is ignored in Scheduled Execution.

[[earlyReturnRequested,`earlyReturnRequested`]]
* `earlyReturnRequested`: If and only if <<canReturnEarly,`canReturnEarly == fmi3True`>>, the co-simulation algorithm may request the FMU to return early from <<fmi3DoStep>> by setting `earlyReturnRequested == fmi3True`. +
This argument is ignored in Scheduled Execution.

[[earlyReturnTime,`earlyReturnTime`]]
* `earlyReturnTime` is used to signal the FMU at which time to return early from the current <<fmi3DoStep>>, if the return value of <<earlyReturnRequested, `earlyReturnRequested == fmi3True`>>.
If the <<earlyReturnTime>> is greater than the last signaled <<intermediateUpdateTime>>, the FMU may integrate up to the time instant <<earlyReturnTime>>. +
This argument is ignored in Scheduled Execution.

Allowed Function Calls::

Function <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>>::
This function can be called for intermediate variables, if <<intermediateVariableGetAllowed,`intermediateVariableGetAllowed == fmi3True`>>.
Intermediate variables are variables that are marked with attribute <<intermediateUpdate,`intermediateUpdate = true`>> in the <<modelDescription.xml>> and have been included in the <<requiredIntermediateVariables>> argument to <<fmi3Instantiate>>.

+
For details on <<fmi3GetOutputDerivatives>> see <<getting-output-derivatives>>.

Function <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Set{VariableType}`>>::
This function can be called for intermediate input variables, if <<intermediateVariableSetRequested,`intermediateVariableSetRequested == fmi3True`>>.
Intermediate input variables are input variables that are marked with attribute <<intermediateUpdate,`intermediateUpdate = true`>> in the <<modelDescription.xml>> and have been included in the <<requiredIntermediateVariables>> argument of <<fmi3Instantiate>>.
In Co-Simulation, <<discrete>> <<input,`inputs`>> must not be set.

There is a defined order of calling these functions: first all <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>> calls must be performed, then <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Set{VariableType}`>> may be called. +
_[This is analogous to the calling sequence of_ <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>> _and_ <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Set{VariableType}`>> _calls at communication points.]_

Additionally to the functions listed above, Scheduled Execution allows calling the following functions:

Function <<fmi3GetClock>>::
The scheduling algorithm uses <<fmi3GetClock>> to determine which clock is active. +
_[For efficiency, <<fmi3GetClock>> should only be called if <<clocksTicked, `clocksTicked == fmi3True`>>.]_ +
Depending on the clock activation state, the scheduling algorithm can call <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Set{VariableType}`>> and <<get-and-set-variable-values,`fmi3Get{VariableType}`>> for variables associated with the corresponding <<clock>>.
For an <<outputClock>> only the first call of `fmi3GetClock` for a specific activation of this <<clock>> signals `fmi3ClockActive`.
The FMU sets the reported activation state immediately back to `fmi3ClockInactive` for following `fmi3GetClock` calls for that <<clock>> until this <<outputClock>> is activated again.

Functions <<fmi3GetIntervalDecimal>> & <<fmi3GetIntervalFraction>>::
These function calls are allowed for <<inputClock, input clocks>>.

_[In Scheduled Execution it cannot be determined which model partition has called <<fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate>>, because multiple model partitions can be active at the same time._
_Since all information about which model partition to activate is coded into its corresponding clock, there is no need to know which potentially other model partition activated this clock.]_
