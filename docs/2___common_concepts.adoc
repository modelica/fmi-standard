== Common Concepts [[fmi-common-concepts]]

The FMI defines the following interface types: FMI for Model Exchange, Co-Simulation, and Scheduled Execution.
The concepts defined in this chapter are common to at least two of these interface types.
The definitions that are specific to the particular cases are defined in <<fmi-for-model-exchange>>, <<fmi-for-co-simulation>>, and <<fmi-for-scheduled-execution>>.

The term _FMU_ (Functional Mock-Up Unit) denotes an implementation (or any mix) of interface types.

In the following, we assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of the C programming language and the basics of numerical simulation.
Please refer to <<glossary>> for the most commonly used terms.
