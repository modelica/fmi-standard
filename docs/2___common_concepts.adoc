== Common Concepts [[fmi-common-concepts]]

The concepts defined in this chapter are defined that are common for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation interface types (Co-Simulation for short).
In both cases, FMI defines an input/output block of a dynamic model where the distribution of the block, the platform dependent header file, several access functions, as well as the schema files are identical.
The definitions that are specific to the particular cases are defined in <<fmi-for-model-exchange>> and <<fmi-for-basic-co-simulation>>.

Below, the term _FMU_ (Functional Mock-up Unit) will be used as common term for a model following the interface type FMI for Model Exchange, or a co-simulation slave following one or the three Co-Simulation interface types Basic Co-Simulation, Hybrid Co-Simulation or Scheduled Co-Simulation.
Note that the standard supports several interface types to co-exist inside one FMU.
