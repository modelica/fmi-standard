== FMI Common Concepts for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation

The concepts defined in this chapter are defined that are common for "model exchange" and "co-simulation".
In both cases, FMI defines an input/output block of a dynamic model where the distribution of the block,
the platform dependent header file, several access functions, as well as the schema files are identical.
The definitions that are specific to the particular cases are defined in chapters 3 and 4.

Below, the term __FMU__ (Functional Mock-up Unit) will be used as common term for a model in the "FMI for
model exchange" format, or a co-simulation [underline]#slave# in the "FMI for co-simulation" format.
Note that the
interface supports [underline]#several instances# of [underline]#one FMU#.
