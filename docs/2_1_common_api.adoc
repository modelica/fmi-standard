=== FMI Application Programming Interface

This section contains the common interface definitions to execute functions of an FMU from a C program.

Note that he following general properties hold for an FMU:

- FMI functions of one instance do not need to be thread-safe. +
_[For example, if the functions of one instance of an FMU are accessed from more than one thread;
the multi-threaded environment that uses the FMU must guarantee that the calling sequences of functions defined in section 3.2.3 and section 4.2.4. are used.
The FMU itself does not implement any services to support this.]_

- FMI functions must not change global settings which affect other processes/threads.
An FMI function may change settings of the process/thread in which it is called (such as floating point control registers),
provided these changes are restored before leaving the function or before a callback function is called. +
_[This property ensures that functions of different FMU instances can be called safely in any order.
Additionally, they can be called in parallel provided the functions are called in different process/threads.
If an FMI function changes for example the floating point control word of the CPU,
it must restore the previous value before return of the function.
For x86 CPUs, the floating point control word is set using the fldcw instruction.
This can be used to switch on additional exceptions such as "floating point division by zero".
An FMU might temporarily change the floating point control word and get notified on floating point exceptions internally,
but has to restore the flag and clear the floating point status word before return of the respective FMI function.]_


==== Header Files and Naming of Functions

Three header files are provided that define the interface of an FMU.
In all header files the convention is used that all C function and type definitions start with the prefix "[underline]#fmi2#":

- `fmi2TypesPlatform.h` +
contains the type definitions of the input and output arguments of the functions.
This header file must
be used both by the FMU and by the target simulator.
If the target simulator has different definitions in
the header file (for example, `**typedef float** fmi2Real` instead of `**typedef double** fmi2Real`),
then the [underline]#FMU# needs to be [underline]#re-compiled# with the header file used by the [underline]#target simulator#.
Note that the header file platform for which the model was compiled can be inquired in the target simulator with
`fmi2GetTypesPlatform` (see section 2.1.4). +
_[Example for a definition in this header file: +
 `**typedef double** fmi2Real;` +
 ]_

- `fmi2FunctionTypes.h` +
contains `**typedef**` definitions of all function prototypes of an FMU.
When dynamically loading an FMU,
these definitions can be used to type-cast the function pointers to the respective function definition.
_[Example for a definition in this header file: +
 `**typedef** fmi2Status fmi2SetTimeTYPE(fmi2Component, fmi2Real);` +
 ]_

- `fmi2Functions.h` +
contains the function prototypes of an FMU that can be accessed in simulation environments and that
are defined in chapters 2, 3, and 4.
This header file includes `fmi2TypesPlatform.h` and
`fmi2FunctionTypes.h`.
The header file version number for which the model was compiled,
can be inquired in the target simulator with `fmi2GetVersion` (see section 2.1.4).
_[Example for a definition in this header file_ footnote:[For Microsoft and Cygwin compilers;
`FMI2_Export` is defined as `pass:[__]declspec(dllexport)` and for Gnu-Compilers `FMI2_Export` is defined as `pass:[__]attribute__ ( ( visibility("default") ) )` in order to export the name for dynamic loading.
Otherwise it is an empty definition.]: +
_`FMI2_Export fmi2SetTimeTYPE fmi2SetTime;` +
]_

The goal is that both textual and binary representations of FMUs are supported and that several FMUs
might be present at the same time in an executable (for example, FMU A may use an FMU B).
In order for this to be possible,
the names of the functions in different FMUs must be different, or function pointers must be used.
To support the first variant macros are provided in `fmi2Functions.h` to build the actual
function names by using a function prefix that depends on how the FMU is shipped.
_[These macros can be defined differently in a target specific variant of `fmi2Functions.h` to adjust them to the requirements of the supported compilers and platforms of the importing tool.]_

An FMU C-file must include at the beginning a `define` of `FMI2_FUNCTION_PREFIX` as the `modelIdentifier` attribute defined in `<fmiModelDescription><ModelExchange>` or `<fmiModelDescription><CoSimulation>`together with `pass:[_]` at the end (see sections 3.3.1 and 4.3.1).

This `define` must be directly follwed with an `#include "fmi2Functions.h"` statement.

Typically, FMU functions are used as follows:

[source, C]
----
// FMU is shipped with C source code, or with static link library
#define FMI2_FUNCTION_PREFIX MyModel_
#include "fmi2Functions.h"
< usage of the FMU functions >
----

[source, C]
----
// FMU is shipped with DLL/SharedObject
#include "fmi2Functions.h"
< usage of the FMU functions >
----

A function that is defined as `fmi2GetReal` is changed by the macros to a function name as follows:

- If the FMU is shipped with C source code or with static link library: +
The constructed function name is `MyModel_fmi2GetReal`.
In other words the function name is prefixed with the model identifier and an `pass:[_]`.
A simulation environment can therefore construct the relevant function names by
generating code for the actual function call.
In case of a static link library, the name of the library is MyModel.lib on Windows
and libMyModel.a on Linux; in other words the `modelIdentifier` attribute is used as library name.

- If the FMU is shipped with DLL/SharedObject: +
The constructed function name is `fmi2GetReal`, in other words, it is not changed.
_[This can be realized in the case of a source code FMU with a target-specific version of `fmi2Functions.h` that does not use FMI2_FUNCTION_PREFIX to construct the function names.]_
A simulation environment will then dynamically load this library and will explicitly import the function symbols by providing the FMI function names as strings.
The name of the library is `MyModel.dll` on Windows or `MyModel.so` on Linux;
in other words the `modelIdentifier` attribute is used as library name.

_[An FMU can be optionally shipped so that it basically contains only the communication to another tool
(needsExecutionTool = true, see section 4.3.1).
This is particularily common for co-simulation tasks.
In FMI 1.0, the function names are always prefixed with the model name and therefore a DLL/Shared
Object has to be generated for every model.
FMI 2.0 improves this situation since model names are no longer used as prefix in case of DLL/Shared Objects:
Therefore one DLL/Shared Object can be used for all models in case of tool coupling.
If an FMU is imported into a simulation environment,
this is usually performed dynamically (based on the FMU name,
the corresponding FMU is loaded during execution of
the simulation environment) and then it does not matter whether a model name is prefixed or not.]_

Since `modelIdentifier` is used as prefix of a C-function name it must fulfill the restrictions on C-function
names (only letters,
digits and/or underscores are allowed).
_[For example, if `modelName = "A.B.C"`, then `modelIdentifier` might be "A_B_C".]_
Since `modelIdentifier` is also used as name in a
file system, it must also fulfill the restrictions of the targeted operating system.
Basically, this means that it should be short.
For example, the Windows API only supports full path-names of a file up to 260
characters (see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247%28VS.85%29.aspx).


==== Platform Dependent Definitions (fmi2TypesPlatform.h)

To simplify porting, no C types are used in the function interfaces,
but the alias types are defined in this section.
All definitions in this section are provided in the header file `fmi2TypesPlatform.h`.

`#define fmi2TypesPlatform "default"`

A definition that can be inquired with `fmi2GetTypesPlatform`.
It is used to uniquely identify the header file used for compilation of a binary.
_[The "default" definition below is suitable for most common platforms.
It is recommended to use this "default" definition for all binary FMUs.
Only for source code FMUs, a change might be useful in some cases.]_:

----
fmi2Component           : an opaque object pointer
fmi2ComponentEnvironment: an opaque object pointer
fmi2FMUstate            : an opaque object pointer
fmi2ValueReference      : value handle type
fmi2Real                : real data type
fmi2Integer             : integer data type
fmi2Boolean             : datatype to be used with fmi2True and fmi2False
fmi2Char                : character data type (size of one character)
fmi2String              : pointer to a vector of fmi2Char characters
                          ('\0' terminated, UTF-8 encoded)
fmi2Byte                : smallest addressable unit of the machine
                          (typically one byte)
----

[source, C]
----
typedef void* fmi2Component;
----

This is a pointer to an FMU specific data structure that contains the information needed to
process the model equations or to process the co-simulation of the respective slave.
This data structure is implemented by the environment that provides the FMU;
in other words, the calling environment does not know its content, and
the code to process it must be provided by the FMU
generation environment and must be shipped with the FMU.

[source, C]
----
typedef void* fmi2ComponentEnvironment;
----

This is a pointer to a data structure in the simulation environment that calls the FMU.
Using this pointer, data from the `modelDescription.xml` file
_[for example, mapping of `valueReference`pass:[s] to variable names]_
can be transferred between the simulation environment and the `logger` function (see section 2.1.5).

[source, C]
----
typedef void* fmi2FMUstate;
----

This is a pointer to a data structure in the FMU that saves the internal FMU state of the actual or a previous time instant.
This allows to restart a simulation from a previous FMU state (see section 2.1.8).


[source, C]
----
typedef unsigned int fmi2ValueReference;
----

This is a handle to a (base type) variable value of the model.
Handle and base type (such as `fmi2Real`) uniquely identify the value of a variable.
Variables of the same base type that have the same handle, always have identical values,
but other parts of the variable definition might be different _[for example, min/max attributes]_.

All structured entities, such as records or arrays,
are "flattened" into a set of scalar values of type `fmi2Real`, `fmi2Integer` etc.
An `fmi2ValueReference` references one such scalar.
The coding of `fmi2ValueReference` is a "secret" of the environment that generated the FMU.
The interface to the equations only provides access to variables via this handle.
Extracting concrete information about a variable is specific to the used environment that reads the Model Description File in which the value handles are defined.
If a function in the following sections is called with a wrong `fmi2ValueReference` value
_[for example, setting a constant with a `fmi2SetReal(..)` function call]_,
then the function has to return with an error ( `fmi2Status = fmi2Error`, see section 2.1.3).

[source, C]
----
typedef double fmi2Real ; // Data type for floating point real numbers
typedef int fmi2Integer;  // Data type for signed integer numbers
typedef int fmi2Boolean;  // Data type for Boolean numbers
                          // (only two values: fmi2False, fmi2True)
typedef char fmi2Char;    // Data type for one character
typedef const fmi2Char* fmi2String; // Data type for character strings
                                    // ('\0' terminated, UTF8 encoded)
typedef char fmi2Byte;    // Data type for the smallest addressable
                          // unit, typically one byte
#define fmi2True 1
#define fmi2False 0
----

These are the basic data types used in the interfaces of the C functions.
More data types might be included in future versions of the interface.
In order to keep flexibility, especially for embedded systems or for high performance computers,
the exact data types or the word length of a number are not standardized.
Instead, the precise definition (in other words, the header file `fmi2TypesPlatform.h`) is provided by the environment where the FMU shall be used.
In most cases, the definition above will be used.
If the target environment has different definitions and the FMU is distributed in binary format,
it must be newly compiled and linked with this target header file.

If an `fmi2String` variable is passed as [underline]#input# argument to an FMI function and the FMU needs to use the string later,
the FMI function must copy the string before it returns and store it in the internal FMU memory,
because there is no guarantee for the lifetime of the string after the function has returned.

If an `fmi2String` variable is passed as [underline]#output# argument from an FMI function and the string shall be used in the target environment,
the target environment must copy the whole string (not only the pointer).
The memory of this string may be deallocated by the next call to any of the FMI interface functions. (The string memory might also be just a buffer, that is reused.)


==== Status Returned by Functions
This section defines the `status` flag (an enumeration of type `fmi2Status` defined in file
`fmi2FunctionTypes.h` ) that is returned by all functions to indicate the success of the function call:


[source, C]
----
typedef enum { fmi2OK,
               fmi2Warning,
               fmi2Discard,
               fmi2Error,
               fmi2Fatal,
               fmi2Pending } fmi2Status;
----

Status returned by functions.
The status has the following meaning

- `fmi2OK` - all well.

- `fmi2Warning` - things are not quite right, but the computation can continue.
Function `logger` was called in the model (see below), and it is expected that
this function has shown the prepared information message to the user.

- `fmi2Discard` - this return status is only possible if explicitly defined for the corresponding function
footnote:[Functions `fmi2SetXXX` are usually not performing calculations but just store the passed values in internal buffers.
The actual calculation is performed by `fmi2GetXXX` functions.
Still `fmi2SetXXX` functions could check whether the input arguments are in their validity range.
If not, these functions could return with `fmi2Discard`.]:
(ModelExchange: `fmi2SetReal`, `fmi2SetInteger`, `fmi2SetBoolean`, `fmi2SetString`,
`fmi2SetContinuousStates`, `fmi2GetReal`, `fmi2GetDerivatives`,
`fmi2GetContinuousStates`, `fmi2GetEventIndicators`;
CoSimulation: `fmi2SetReal`, `fmi2SetInteger`, `fmi2SetBoolean`, `fmi2SetString`, `fmi2DoStep`,
`fmiGetXXXStatus` ): +
For "model exchange": It is recommended to perform a smaller step size and evaluate the model
equations again, for example because an iterative solver in the model did not converge or because a
function is outside of its domain [for example, `sqrt(<negative number>)`].
If this is not possible, the simulation has to be terminated. +
For "co-simulation": `fmi2Discard` is returned also if the slave is not able to return the required
status information.
The master has to decide if the simulation run can be continued. +
In both cases, function `logger` was called in the FMU (see below), and it is expected that this
function has shown the prepared information message to the user if the FMU was called in debug
mode (`loggingOn = fmi2True`).
Otherwise, `logger` should not show a message.

- `fmi2Error` - the FMU encountered an error.
The simulation cannot be continued with this FMU instance.
If one of the functions returns `fmi2Error`,
it can be tried to restart the simulation from a formerly stored FMU state by calling `fmi2SetFMUstate`.
This can be done if the capability flag `canGetAndSetFMUstate` is true and
`fmi2GetFMUstate` was called before in non-erroneous state.
If not, the simulation cannot be continued and `fmi2FreeInstance` or `fmi2Reset` [.underline]#must# be called
afterwards.footnote:[Typically, `fmi2Error` return is for non-numerical reasons, like "disk full".
There might be cases where the environment can fix such errors (eventually with the help oft the user),
and then simulation can continue at the last consistent state defined with `fmi2SetFMUstate`.] +
Further processing is possible after this call;
especially other FMU instances are not affected.
Function `logger` was called in the FMU (see below), and it is expected that this function has shown
the prepared information message to the user.

- `fmi2Fatal` - the model computations are irreparably corrupted for all FMU instances.
_[For example, due to a run-time exception such as access violation or integer division by zero during the execution of an fmi function]_.
Function `logger` was called in the FMU (see below), and it is expected that this
function has shown the prepared information message to the user.
It is not possible to call any other function for any of the FMU instances.

- `fmi2Pending` - this status is returned only from the co-simulation interface,
if the slave executes the function in an asynchronous way.
That means the slave starts to compute but returns immediately.
The master has to call `fmi2GetStatus(..., fmi2DoStepStatus)` to determine
if the slave has finished the computation.
Can be returned only by `fmi2DoStep` and by `fmi2GetStatus` (see section 4.2.3).


==== Inquire Platform and Version Number of Header Files

This section documents functions to inquire information about the header files used to compile its functions.

[source, C]
----
const char* fmi2GetTypesPlatform(void);
----

Returns the string to uniquely identify the `fmi2TypesPlatform.h`
header file used for compilation of the functions of the FMU.
The function returns a pointer to a static string specified by `fmi2TypesPlatform`
defined in this header file.
The standard header file, as documented in this specification,
has `fmi2TypesPlatform` set to `default` (so this function usually returns `default`).

[source, C]
----
const char* fmi2GetVersion(void);
----

Returns the version of the `fmi2Functions.h` header file which was used to compile the functions of the FMU.
The function returns `fmiVersion` which is defined in this header file.
The standard header file as documented in this specification has version `"2.0"` (so this function usually returns `"2.0"`).


==== Creation, Destruction and Logging of FMU Instances

This section documents functions that deal with instantiation, destruction and logging of FMUs.

[source, C]
----
fmi2Component fmi2Instantiate(fmi2String  instanceName,
                              fmi2Type    fmuType,
                              fmi2String fmuGUID,
                              fmi2String fmuResourceLocation,
                              const fmi2CallbackFunctions* functions,
                              fmi2Boolean visible,
                              fmi2Boolean loggingOn);
----

[source, C]
----
typedef enum {fmi2ModelExchange,
              fmi2CoSimulation
             }fmi2Type;
----

The function returns a new instance of an FMU.
If a null pointer is returned, then instantiation failed.
In that case, `functions->logger` is called with detailed information about the reason.
An FMU can be instantiated many times (provided capability flag `canBeInstantiatedOnlyOncePerProcess = false`).

This function must be called successfully before any of the following functions can be called.
For co-simulation, this function call has to perform all actions of a slave which are necessary
before a simulation run starts (for example, loading the model file, compilation...).

Argument `instanceName` is a unique identifier for the FMU instance.
It is used to name the instance,
for example, in error or information messages generated by one of the `fmi2XXX` functions.
It is not allowed to provide a null pointer and this string must be non-empty
(in other words, must have at least one character that is no white space).
_[If only one FMU is simulated, as instanceName attribute `modelName` or
`<ModelExchange/CoSimulation modelIdentifier="..">` from the XML schema `fmiModelDescription` might be used.]_

Argument `fmuType` defines the type of the FMU:

- = `fmi2ModelExchange`: FMU with initialization and events;
between events simulation of continuous systems is performed with
external integrators from the environment (see section 3).
- = `fmi2CoSimulation`: Black box interface for co-simulation (see section 4).

Argument `fmuGUID` is used to check that the `modelDescription.xml` file
(see section 2.3) is compatible with the C code of the FMU.
It is a vendor specific globally unique identifier of the XML file
(for example, it is a "fingerprint" of the relevant information stored in the XML file).
It is stored in the XML file as attribute "guid" (see section 2.2.1)
and has to be passed to the `fmi2Instantiate` function via argument `fmuGUID`.
It must be identical to the one stored inside the `fmi2Instantiate` function;
otherwise the C code and the XML file of the FMU are not consistent with each other.
This argument cannot be null.

Argument `fmuResourceLocation` is a URI according to the
http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3986/[IETF RFC3986] syntax to indicate the location
to the `resources` directory of the unzipped FMU archive.
The following schemes must be understood by the FMU:

- Mandatory: "file" with absolute path (either including or omitting the authority component)
- Optional: "http", "https", "ftp"
- Reserved: "fmi2" for FMI for PLM.

_[Example: An FMU is unzipped in directory "C:\temp\MyFMU", then fmuResourceLocation = "file:///C:/temp/MyFMU/resources" or "file:/C:/temp/MyFMU/resources".
Function `fmi2Instantiate` is then able to read all needed resources from this directory,
for example maps or tables used by the FMU.]_

Argument `functions` provides callback functions to be used from the FMU functions to utilize resources from the environment (see type `fmi2CallbackFunctions` below).

Argument `visible = fmi2False` defines that the interaction with the user should be reduced to a minimum
(no application window, no plotting, no animation, etc.).
In other words, the FMU is executed in batch mode.
If `visible = fmi2True`,
the FMU is executed in interactive mode, and the FMU might require to explicitly acknowledge start of
simulation / instantiation / initialization (acknowledgment is non-blocking).

If `loggingOn = fmi2True`, debug logging is enabled. +
If `loggingOn = fmi2False`, debug logging is disabled.

_[The FMU enable/disables `LogCategories` which are useful for debugging according to this argument.
Which `LogCategories` the FMU sets is unspecified.]_

[source, C]
----
typedef struct {
     void  (*logger)(fmi2ComponentEnvironment componentEnvironment,
                          fmi2String instanceName,
                          fmi2Status status,
                          fmi2String category,
                          fmi2String message, ...);
     void* (*allocateMemory)(size_t nobj, size_t size);
     void  (*freeMemory)    (void* obj);
     void (*stepFinished)   (fmi2ComponentEnvironment componentEnvironment,
                             fmi2Status status);
     fmi2ComponentEnvironment componentEnvironment;
} fmi2CallbackFunctions;
----

The struct contains pointers to functions provided by the environment to be used by the FMU.
It is not allowed to change these functions between `fmi2Instantiate(..)` and `fmi2Terminate(..)` calls.
Additionally,
a pointer to the environment is provided (componentEnvironment) that needs to be passed to the `logger` function,
in order that the `logger` function can utilize data from the environment,
such as mapping a `valueReference` to a string.
In the unlikely case that `fmi2Component` is also needed in the `logger`,
it has to be passed via argument `componentEnvironment`.
Argument `componentEnvironment` may be a null pointer.

The `componentEnvironment` pointer is also passed to the `stepFinished(..)` function in order
that the environment can provide an efficient way to identify the slave that called `stepFinished(..)`.

In the default `fmi2FunctionTypes.h` file,
typedefs for the function definitions are present to simplify the usage;
this is non-normative.
The functions have the following meaning:

Function *logger*:
Pointer to a function that is called by the FMU _[usually if an `fmi2XXX` function does not behave as desired]_.
If `status = fmi2OK`, the message is a pure information message.
`instanceName` is the name of the FMU instance that calls this function.
`category` is the category of the message.

The allowed values for `category` are defined in the `modelDescription.xml` file via the element `<fmiModelDescription><LogCategories>`, see section 2.2.4.
`logger` should only be called for log categories that were enabled by a call to `fmi2SetDebugLogging` (see below) or via `loggingOn = fmi2True` in `fmi2Instantiate`.
If the FMU does not define any log categories, `category` must be `NULL`.
Argument `message` is a string that contains the message to log.
It may contain line-breaks (`\n`), but should not have a trailing line break and is provided in the same way and with the
same format control as in function `printf` from the C standard library. +
_[Typically, this function prints the message and stores it optionally in a log file.]_

All string-valued arguments passed by the FMU to the `logger` may be deallocated by the FMU directly after function `logger` returns.
_[The simulation environment must therefore create copies of these strings if it needs to access these strings later.]_ +

Variables are referenced in a message with `\#<Type><ValueReference>#` where <Type> is "r" for `fmi2Real`,
"i" for `fmi2Integer`, "b" for `fmi2Boolean` and "s" for `fmi2String`.
If character `pass:[#]` shall be included in the message,
it has to be prefixed with `pass:[#]`, so `#` is an escape character.
_[Example:_


_A message of the form "\#r1365#" must be larger than zero (used in IO channel ##4)"_ +
_might be changed by the `logger` function to_ +
_`"body.m must be larger than zero (used in IO channel #4)"`_ +
_if `"body.m"` is the name of the `fmi2Real` variable with `fmi2ValueReference = 1365`.]_

Function *allocateMemory*: +
Pointer to a function that is called in the FMU if memory needs to be allocated.
If attribute `canNotUseMemoryManagementFunctions = true` in `<fmiModelDescription><ModelExchange / CoSimulation>`,
then function `allocateMemory` is not used in the FMU and a void pointer can be provided.
If this attribute has a value of `false` (which is the default),
the FMU must not use `malloc`, `calloc` or other memory allocation functions.
One reason is that these functions might not be available for embedded systems on the target machine.
Another reason is that the environment may have optimized or specialized memory allocation functions.
`allocateMemory` returns a pointer to space for a vector of `nobj` objects,
each of size `size` or `NULL`, if the request cannot be satisfied.
The space is initialized to zero bytes _[(a simple implementation is to use `calloc` from the C standard library)]_.

Function *freeMemory*: +
Pointer to a function that must be called in the FMU if memory is freed that has been allocated with `allocateMemory`.
If a null pointer is provided as input argument `obj`,
the function shall perform no action _[(a simple implementation is to use free from the C standard library;
in ANSI C89 and C99, the null pointer handling is identical as defined here)]_.
If attribute `canNotUseMemoryManagementFunctions = true` in `<fmiModelDescription><ModelExchange / CoSimulation>`,
then function `freeMemory` is not used in the FMU and a null pointer can be provided.

Function *stepFinished*: +
Optional call back function to signal if the computation of a communication step of a co- simulation slave is finished.
A null pointer can be provided.
In this case the master must use `fmiGetStatus(..)` to query the status of `fmi2DoStep`.
If a pointer to a function is provided, it must be called by the FMU after a completed communication step.

_[Note: In FMI 3.0, memory callback functions were removed, because their intended uses failed to materialize and the implementations often had issues.
New in FMI 2.0.2: It is discouraged to use the memory callback functions.]_

[source, C]
----
void fmi2FreeInstance(fmi2Component c);
----

Disposes the given instance, unloads the loaded model,
and frees all the allocated memory and other resources that have been allocated by the functions of the FMU interface.
If a null pointer is provided for `c`, the function call is ignored (does not have an effect).


[source, C]
----
fmi2Status fmi2SetDebugLogging(fmi2Component c, fmi2Boolean loggingOn,
                               size_t nCategories,
                               const fmi2String categories[]);
----
The function controls the debug logging that is output via the logger callback function by the FMU.

If `loggingOn == fmi2True`, debug logging is enabled for the log categories specified in `categories`, otherwise it is disabled.
`nCategories` defines the length of the argument `categories`.
If `nCategories == 0`, `loggingOn` applies to all log categories and the value of categories is undefined.
The allowed values of `categories` are defined in the `modelDescription.xml` file via element `<LogCategories>`, see section 2.2.4.

==== Initialization, Termination, and Resetting an FMU

This section documents functions that deal with initialization, termination, and resetting of an FMU.

[source, C]
----
fmi2Status fmi2SetupExperiment(fmi2Component c,
                               fmi2Boolean   toleranceDefined,
                               fmi2Real      tolerance,
                               fmi2Real      startTime,
                               fmi2Boolean   stopTimeDefined,
                               fmi2Real      stopTime);
----

Informs the FMU to set up the experiment.
This function must be called after `fmi2Instantiate` and before `fmi2EnterInitializationMode` is called.
Arguments `toleranceDefined` and `tolerance` depend on the FMU type:

[role=second-indented]
*fmuType = fmi2ModelExchange*: +
If `toleranceDefined = fmi2True`, then the model is called with a numerical integration scheme where the
step size is controlled by using `tolerance` for error estimation (usually as relative 'tolerance').
In such a case all numerical algorithms used inside the model (for example, to solve non-linear algebraic
equations) should also operate with an error estimation of an appropriate smaller relative tolerance.

[role=second-indented]
*fmuType = fmi2CoSimulation*: +
If `toleranceDefined = fmi2True`, then the communication interval of the slave is controlled by error estimation.
In case the slave utilizes a numerical integrator with variable step size and error estimation,
it is suggested to use `tolerance` for the error estimation of the internal integrator
(usually as relative tolerance). +
An FMU for Co-Simulation might ignore this argument.

The arguments `startTime` and `stopTime` can be used to check whether the model is valid within
the given boundaries or to allocate memory which is necessary for storing results.
Argument `startTime` is the fixed initial value of the independent variable
footnote:[The variable that is defined with `causality = "independent"` in the `fmiModelDescription.xml` file.]
value _[if the independent variable is `time`, `startTime` is the starting time of initializaton]_.
If `stopTimeDefined = fmi2True`,
then `stopTime` is the defined final value of the independent variable [if the independent variable is `time`,
`stopTime` is the stop time of the simulation] and if the environment tries to compute past `stopTime` the FMU
has to return `fmi2Status = fmi2Error`.
 If `stopTimeDefined = fmi2False`,
 then no final value of the independent variable is defined and argument `stopTime` is meaningless.


[source, C]
----
fmi2Status fmi2EnterInitializationMode(fmi2Component c);
----

Informs the FMU to enter Initialization Mode.
Before calling this function,
all variables with attribute `<ScalarVariable initial = exact` or `approx>` can be set with
the `fmi2SetXXX` functions (the `ScalarVariable` attributes are defined in the Model Description File,
see section 2.2.7).
Setting other variables is not allowed.
Furthermore, `fmi2SetupExperiment` must be called at least once before calling `fmi2EnterInitializationMode`,
in order that `startTime` is defined.

[source, C]
----
fmi2Status fmi2ExitInitializationMode(fmi2Component c);
----

Informs the FMU to exit Initialization Mode.
For `fmuType = fmi2ModelExchange`,
this function switches off all initialization equations, and the FMU enters Event Mode implicitly;
that is, all continuous-time and active discrete-time equations are available.

[source, C]
----
fmi2Status fmi2Terminate(fmi2Component c);
----

Informs the FMU that the simulation run is terminated.
After calling this function,
the final values of all variables can be inquired with the `fmi2GetXXX(..)` functions.
It is not allowed to call this function after one of the functions returned with a status flag of `fmi2Error` or `fmi2Fatal`.

[source, C]
----
fmi2Status fmi2Reset(fmi2Component c);
----

Is called by the environment to reset the FMU after a simulation run.
The FMU goes into the same state as if `fmi2Instantiate` would have been called.
All variables have their default values.
Before starting a new run, `fmi2SetupExperiment` and `fmi2EnterInitializationMode` have to be called.

==== Getting and Setting Variable Values

All variable values of an FMU are identified with a variable handle called "value reference".
The handle is defined in the `modelDescription.xml` file (as attribute `valueReference` in element `ScalarVariable`).
Element `valueReference` might not be unique for all variables.
If two or more variables of the same base data type (such as `fmi2Real`) have the same `valueReference`,
then they have identical values but other parts of the variable definition might be different
_[for example, min/max attributes]_.

The actual values of the variables that are defined in the `modelDescription.xml`
file can be inquired after calling `fmi2EnterInitializationMode` with the following functions:

[source, C]
----
fmi2Status fmi2GetReal   (fmi2Component c, const fmi2ValueReference vr[],
                          size_t nvr, fmi2Real value[]);
fmi2Status fmi2GetInteger(fmi2Component c, const fmi2ValueReference vr[],
                          size_t nvr, fmi2Integer value[]);
fmi2Status fmi2GetBoolean(fmi2Component c, const fmi2ValueReference vr[],
                          size_t nvr, fmi2Boolean value[]);
fmi2Status fmi2GetString (fmi2Component c, const fmi2ValueReference vr[],
                          size_t nvr, fmi2String value[]);
----

[role=indented2]
Get actual values of variables by providing their variable references.
_[These functions are especially used to get the actual values of output variables if a model is connected with other models.
Since state derivatives are also `ScalarVariable`pass:[s],
it is possible to get the value of a state derivative.
This is useful when connecting FMUs together.
Furthermore, the actual value of every variable defined in the `modelDescription.xml` file
can be determined at the actually defined time instant (see section 2.2.7).]_

[role=indented2]
- Argument `vr` is a vector of `nvr` value handles that define the variables that shall be inquired.
- Argument `value` is a vector with the actual values of these variables.
- The strings returned by `fmi2GetString` must be copied in the target environment
because the allocated memory for these strings might be deallocated by the next call to
any of the fmi2 interface functions or it might be an internal string buffer that is reused.
- For ModelExchange: `fmi2Status = fmi2Discard` is possible for `fmi2GetReal` only,
but not for `fmi2GetInteger`, `fmi2GetBoolean`, `fmi2GetString`,
because these are discrete-time variables and their values can only change at
an event instant where `fmi2Discard` does not make sense.

It is also possible to [underline]#set# the values of [underline]#certain# variables at particular instants in time using the following functions:

[source, C]
----
fmi2Status fmi2SetReal   (fmi2Component c, const fmi2ValueReference vr[],
                          size_t nvr, const fmi2Real value[]);
fmi2Status fmi2SetInteger(fmi2Component c, const fmi2ValueReference vr[],
                          size_t nvr, const fmi2Integer value[]);
fmi2Status fmi2SetBoolean(fmi2Component c, const fmi2ValueReference vr[],
                          size_t nvr, const fmi2Boolean value[]);
fmi2Status fmi2SetString (fmi2Component c, const fmi2ValueReference vr[],
                          size_t nvr, const fmi2String value[]);
----

[role=indented2]
Set parameters, inputs, and start values, and re-initialize caching of variables that depend on these variables
(see section 2.2.7 for the exact rules on which type of variables `fmi2SetXXX` can be called,
as well as section 3.2.3 in case of ModelExchange and section 4.2.4 in case of CoSimulation).

[role=indented2]
- Argument `vr` is a vector of `nvr` value handles that define the variables that shall be set.
- Argument `value` is a vector with the actual values of these variables.
- All strings passed as arguments to `fmi2SetString` must be copied inside this function,
because there is no guarantee of the lifetime of strings when this function returns.
- Note, `fmi2Status = fmi2Discard` is possible for the `fmi2SetXXX` functions.

For co-simulation FMUs,
additional functions are defined in section 4.2.1 to set and inquire derivatives of variables with respect
to time in order to allow interpolation.

[#GetSetCompleteFMUState]
==== Getting and Setting the Complete FMU State

The FMU has an internal state consisting of all values that are needed to continue a simulation.
This internal state consists especially of the values of the continuous-time states, iteration variables,
parameter values, input values, delay buffers, file identifiers, and FMU internal status information.
With the functions of this section,
the internal FMU state can be copied and the pointer to this copy is returned to the environment.
The FMU state copy can be set as actual FMU state, in order to continue the simulation from it.

_[Examples for using this feature:_

_For variable step-size control of co-simulation master algorithms (get the FMU state for every accepted
communication step;
if the follow-up step is not accepted, restart co-simulation from this FMU state)._

_For nonlinear Kalman filters (get the FMU state just before initialization;
in every sample period, set new continuous states from the Kalman filter algorithm based on measured values;
integrate to the next sample instant and inquire the predicted continuous states that are used
in the Kalman filter algorithm as basis to set new continuous states)._

_For nonlinear model predictive control (get the FMU state just before initialization;
in every sample period, set new continuous states from an observer,
initialize and get the FMU state after initialization.
From this state, perform many simulations that are restarted after the initialization with new input signals proposed by the optimizer).]_

Furthermore, the FMU state can be serialized and copied in a byte vector:
_[This can be, for example, used to perform an expensive steady-state initialization,
copy the received FMU state in a byte vector and store this vector on file.
Whenever needed, the byte vector can be loaded from file
and deserialized, and the simulation can be restarted from this FMU state,
in other words, from the steady-state initialization.]_

[source, C]
----
fmi2Status fmi2GetFMUstate (fmi2Component c, fmi2FMUstate* FMUstate);
fmi2Status fmi2SetFMUstate (fmi2Component c, fmi2FMUstate  FMUstate);
fmi2Status fmi2FreeFMUstate(fmi2Component c, fmi2FMUstate* FMUstate);
----

`fmi2GetFMUstate` makes a copy of the internal FMU state and returns a pointer to this copy (`FMUstate`).
If on entry `*FMUstate == NULL`, a new allocation is required.
If `*FMUstate != NULL`, then `*FMUstate` points to a previously returned `FMUstate` that has not been modified since.
In particular, `fmi2FreeFMUstate` had not been called with this `FMUstate` as an argument.
_[Function `fmi2GetFMUstate` typically reuses the memory of this `FMUstate`
in this case and returns the same pointer to it, but with the actual `FMUstate`.]_

`fmi2SetFMUstate` copies the content of the previously copied `FMUstate` back and uses it as actual new FMU state.
The `FMUstate` copy still exists.

`fmi2FreeFMUstate` frees all memory and other resources allocated with the `fmi2GetFMUstate` call for this `FMUstate`.
The input argument to this function is the `FMUstate` to be freed.
If a null pointer is provided, the call is ignored.
The function returns a null pointer in argument `FMUstate`.

These functions are only supported by the FMU,
if the optional capability flag `canGetAndSetFMUstate` in `<fmiModelDescription> <ModelExchange / CoSimulation> `
in the XML file is explicitly set to `true` (see sections 3.3.1 and 4.3.1).

[source, C]
----
mi2Status fmi2SerializedFMUstateSize(fmi2Component c, fmi2FMUstate FMUstate,
                                     size_t *size);
fmi2Status fmi2SerializeFMUstate    (fmi2Component c, fmi2FMUstate FMUstate,
                                     fmi2Byte serializedState[], size_t size);
fmi2Status fmi2DeSerializeFMUstate  (fmi2Component c,
                                     const fmi2Byte serializedState[],
                                     size_t size, fmi2FMUstate* FMUstate);
----

`fmi2SerializedFMUstateSize` returns the `size` of the byte vector,
in order that `FMUstate` can be stored in it.
With this information, the environment has to allocate an `fmi2Byte` vector of the required length `size`.

`fmi2SerializeFMUstate` serializes the data which is referenced by pointer `FMUstate` and copies this
data in to the byte vector `serializedState` of length `size`, that must be provided by the environment.

`fmi2DeSerializeFMUstate` deserializes the byte vector `serializedState` of length `size`,
constructs a copy of the FMU state and returns `FMUstate`, the pointer to this copy.
_[The simulation is restarted at this state, when calling `fmi2SetFMUState` with `FMUstate`.]_

These functions are only supported by the FMU,
if the optional capability flags `canGetAndSetFMUstate` and `canSerializeFMUstate` in
`<fmiModelDescription><ModelExchange / CoSimulation>` in the XML file are explicitly set to `true` (see sections 3.3.1 and 4.3.1).

==== Getting Partial Derivatives

It is optionally possible to provide evaluation of partial derivatives for an FMU.
For Model Exchange, this means computing the partial derivatives at a particular time instant.
For Co-Simulation, this means to compute the partial derivatives at a particular communication point.
One function is provided to compute directional derivatives.
This function can be used to construct the desired partial derivative matrices.

[source, C]
----
fmi2Status fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative(fmi2Component c,
                      const fmi2ValueReference vUnknown_ref[], size_t nUnknown,
                      const fmi2ValueReference vKnown_ref[] , size_t nKnown,
                      const fmi2Real dvKnown[],
                            fmi2Real dvUnknown[])
----

[role=indented2]
This function computes the directional derivatives of an FMU.
An FMU has different Modes and in every Mode an FMU might be described by different equations and different unknowns.
The precise definitions are given in the mathematical descriptions of Model Exchange (section 3.1) and Co-Simulation (section 4.1).
In every Mode, the general form of the FMU equations are:

[latexmath]
++++
\mathbf{v}_{unknown} = \mathbf{h}(\mathbf{v}_{known}, \mathbf{v}_{rest}),
++++

where

* latexmath:[\color{blue}{\mathbf{v}_{unknown}}] is the vector of unknown Real variables computed in the actual Mode:

** _Initialization Mode_: The exposed unknowns listed under `<ModelStructure><InitialUnknowns>` that have type Real.

** _Continuous-Time Mode (ModelExchange)_: The continuous-time outputs and state derivatives
(= the variables listed under `<ModelStructure><Outputs>` with type Real and `variability = "continuous"` and
the variables listed as state derivatives under `<ModelStructure><Derivatives>`).

** _Event Mode (ModelExchange)_: The same variables as in the Continuous-Time Mode and additionally variables
under `<ModelStructure><Outputs>` with type Real and `variability = "discrete"`.

** _Step Mode (CoSimulation)_: The variables listed under `<ModelStructure><Outputs>` with type Real
and `variability = continuous` or `discrete`.
If `<ModelStructure><Derivatives>` is present, also the variables listed here as state derivatives.

* latexmath:[\color{blue}{\mathbf{v}_{known}}] is the vector of Real input variables of function *h*
that changes its value in the actual Mode.
Details are described in the description of element `dependencies` in section 2.2.8.
_[For example continuous-time inputs in Continuous-Time Mode.
If a variable with `causality = "independent"` is explicitly defined under `ScalarVariable`pass:[s],
a directional derivative with respect to this variable can be computed.
If such a variable is not defined,
the directional derivative with respect to the independent variable cannot be calculated]._

* latexmath:[\color{blue}{\mathbf{v}_{rest}}] is the set of input variables of function *h*
that either changes its value in the actual Mode but are non-Real variables,
or do not change their values in this Mode,
but change their values in other Modes _[for example, discrete-time inputs in Continuous-Time Mode]_.

If the capability attribute `providesDirectionalDerivative` is `true`,
`fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative` computes a linear combination of the partial derivatives of *h* with
respect to the selected input variables latexmath:[\color{blue}{\mathbf{v}_{known}}]:

[latexmath]
++++
\Delta \mathbf{v}_{unknown} = \frac{\delta \mathbf{h}}{\delta \mathbf{v}_{known}}\Delta \mathbf{v}_{known}
++++

Accordingly, it computes the directional derivative vector
latexmath:[\color{blue}{\Delta \mathbf{v}_{unknown}}] (`dvUnknown`) from the seed vector
latexmath:[\color{blue}{\Delta \mathbf{v}_{known}}] (`dvKnown`)

_[The variable relationships are different in different modes.
For example, during Continuous-Time Mode,
a continuous-time output y does not depend on discrete-time inputs (because they are held constant between events).
However, at Event Mode, y depends on discrete-time inputs.]_ +
_The function may compute the directional derivatives by numerical differentiation taking
into account the sparseness of the equation system, or (preferred) by analytic derivatives._

_Example:_ +
_Assume an FMU has the output equations_

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1
\\
y_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
g_1(x, u_1, u_3, u_4)
\\
g_2(x, u_1)
\end{bmatrix}
++++

_and this FMU is connected, so that latexmath:[\color{blue}{y_1, u_1, u_3}] appear in an algebraic loop.
Then the nonlinear solver needs a Jacobian and this Jacobian can be computed (without numerical differentiation)
provided the partial derivative of latexmath:[\color{blue}{y_1}] with respect to
latexmath:[\color{blue}{u_1}] and latexmath:[\color{blue}{u_3}] is available.
Depending on the environment where the FMUs are connected, these derivatives can be provided_

(a) _with one wrapper function around function fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative to compute the directional
derivatives with respect to these two variables (in other words, latexmath:[\color{blue}{v_{unknown} = y_1}],
latexmath:[\color{blue}{v_{known} = \left \{ u_1, u_3 \right \}}]), and then the environment calls
this wrapper function with latexmath:[\color{blue}{\Delta v_{known} = \left \{ 1, 0 \right \}}]
to compute the partial derivative with respect to
latexmath:[\color{blue}{u_1}] and latexmath:[\color{blue}{\Delta v_{known} = \left \{ 0, 1 \right \}}]
to compute the partial derivative with respect to latexmath:[\color{blue}{u_3}], or_

(b) _with two direct function calls of fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative
(in other words, latexmath:[\color{blue}{v_{unknown} = y_1, v_{known} = u_1, \Delta v_{known} = 1}];
and latexmath:[\color{blue}{v_{unknown} = y_1, v_{known} = u_3, \Delta v_{known} = 1}])._

_Note that a direct implementation of this function with analytic derivatives:_

(a) _Provides the directional derivative for all input variables;
so in the above example: latexmath:[\color{blue}{\Delta y_1 = \frac{\delta g_1}{\delta x} \cdot \Delta x + \frac{\delta g_1}{\delta u_1} \cdot \Delta u_1 + \frac{\delta g_1}{\delta u_3} \cdot \Delta u_3 + \frac{\delta g_1}{\delta u_4} \cdot \Delta u_4}]_

(b) _Initializes all seed-values to zero;
so in the above example: latexmath:[\color{blue}{\Delta x = \Delta u_1 = \Delta u_3 = \Delta u_4 = 0}]_

(c) _Computes the directional derivative with the seed-values provided in the function arguments;
so in the above example: latexmath:[\color{blue}{\Delta v_{unknown} = \Delta y_1 (\Delta x = 0, \Delta u_1 = 1, \Delta u_3 = 1, \Delta u_4 = 0)}]]_

_[Note, function fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative can be utilized for the following purposes:_

- _Numerical integrators of stiff methods need matrix latexmath:[\color{blue}{\frac{\delta \mathbf{f}}{\delta \mathbf{x}}}]._

- _If the FMU is connected with other FMUs,
the partial derivatives of the state derivatives and outputs with respect to the continuous
states and the inputs are needed in order to compute the Jacobian for the system of the connected FMUs._

- _If the FMU shall be linearized, the same derivatives as in the previous item are needed._

- _If the FMU is used as the model for an extended Kalman filter,
latexmath:[\color{blue}{\frac{\delta \mathbf{f}}{\delta \mathbf{x}}}] and
latexmath:[\color{blue}{\frac{\delta \mathbf{g}}{\delta \mathbf{x}}}] are needed._

_If a dense matrix shall be computed,
the columns of the matrix can be easily constructed by successive calls of fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative.
For example, constructing the system Jacobian
latexmath:[\color{blue}{\mathbf{A} = \frac{\delta \mathbf{f}}{\delta \mathbf{x}}}]
as dense matrix can be performed in the following way (in pseudocode notation):_

[source, C]
----
m = M_fmi2Instantiate("m", ...)  // "m" is the instance name
                                 // "M_" is the MODEL_IDENTIFIER
// from XML file
nx     = ...   // number of states
x_ref [..] = ...   // vector of value references of cont.-time states
xd_ref[..] = ...   // vector of value references of state derivatives
dvKnown[1] = {1.0}; //seed vector for fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative
...
// If required at this step, compute the Jacobian as dense matrix
   // Set time, states and inputs
   M_fmi2SetTime(m, time)
   M_fmi2SetContinuousStates(m, x, nx)
   M_fmi2SetReal/Integer/Boolean/String(m, ...)
   // Construct the Jacobian elements J[:,:] columnwise
for i in 1:nx loop
  M_fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative(m, xd_ref, nx, x_ref[i], 1, dvKnown, ci);
  J[:,i] = ci;    // ci is an auxiliary vector of nx elements
                  // (it holds the i-th column of the Jacobian)
end for;
----

_If the sparsity of a matrix shall be taken into account,
then the matrix can be constructed in the following way:_

. _The incidence information of the matrix (whether an element is zero or not zero)
is extracted from the XML file from element <ModelStructure>._

. _A so-called graph coloring algorithm is employed to determine the columns
of the matrix that can be computed by one call of fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative.
Efficient graph coloring algorithms are freely available,
such as library ColPack (https://cscapes.cs.purdue.edu/coloringpage/) written in C/C++ (LGPL),
or the routines by Coleman, Garbow, Moré: "Software for estimating sparse Jacobian matrices",
ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software - TOMS ,
vol. 10, no. 3, pp. 346-347, 1984. See e.g. http://www.netlib.org/toms/618._

. _For the columns determined in (2), one call to fmi2DirectionalDerivative is made.
After each such call,
the elements of the resulting directional derivative vector are copied into
their correct locations of the partial derivative matrix._

_More details and implementational notes are available from (Akesson et.al. 2012).]_
