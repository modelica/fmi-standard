=== Mathematical Definitions [[mathematical-definitions]]

This section introduces the mathematical notation used throughout this document.
It is used to describe

 * ordinary differential equations in state-space representations with discontinuities (events),
 * algebraic equation systems,
 * discrete-time equations (sampled-data systems).

FMU and importer use variables to exchange information.
The properties and semantics of variables are described in the <<modelDescription.xml>>.
Access is possible via appropriate API functions.

The <<independent>> variable latexmath:[\mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{T}] _[typically: time]_ is a tuple latexmath:[\mathbf{t} = (\mathbf{t}_R,\mathbf{t}_I)], where latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_R \in \mathbb{R},\ \mathbf{t}_{I} \in \mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}].
The real part latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_R] of this tuple is the <<independent>> variable of the FMU for describing the continuous-time behavior of the model between events.
During continuous-time integration latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_I = 0].
The integer part latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_I] of this tuple is a counter to enumerate (and therefore distinguish) the events at the same continuous-time instant latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_R].
This time definition is also called "super-dense time" in literature, see, for example, <<LZ07>>.
An ordering is defined on latexmath:[\mathbb{\text{T}}] that leads to the notation in <<table-model-exchange-math-notation>>.
_[The notation latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{t}] is from <<BCP10,BCP10>>, adapted from non-standard analysis to super-dense time, in order to precisely define the value from the previous event iteration.]_

_[Assume that an FMU has an event at latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_R=2.1s] and here a variable changes discontinuously._
_If no event iteration occurs, the time instant when the event occurs is defined as (2.1, 0), and the time instant when the integration is restarted is defined as (2.1, 1).]_

The hybrid differential equations exposed by FMI for Model Exchange or wrapped by FMI for Co-Simulation are described as piecewise continuous-time systems.
Discontinuities can occur at time instants latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_0, \mathbf{t}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{t}_n] where latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_i < \mathbf{t}_{i+1}].
These time instants are called `events`.
Events can be known beforehand (= <<time event,`time events`>>), or are defined implicitly (= <<state event,`state`>> and <<step event,`step events`>>), see below.
Between events, variables are either <<continuous>> or do not change their value.
A variable is called discrete-time, if it changes its value only at an event instant.
Otherwise the variable is called continuous-time.
Only floating point variables can be continuous-time.
The following variable subscripts are used to describe the timing behavior of the corresponding variable (for example, latexmath:[\mathbf{v}_d] is a discrete-time variable):

.Conventions and notation used for variable subscripts.
[#table-subscripts]
[cols="1,10"]
|====
|Subscript
|Description

|`c`
|A continuous-time variable is a floating-point variable representing a continuous function of time inside each interval latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_i^+ < \ ^-\mathbf{t}_{i+1}].

|`d`
|A discrete-time variable changes its value only at an event instant latexmath:[\mathbf{t} = (\mathbf{t}_i,n)].
Such a variable can change multiple times at the same continuous-time instant, but only at subsequent super-dense time instants latexmath:[n \in \mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}].

|`k`
|A <<clocked-variable,clocked variable>> is a discrete-time variable associated with a <<clock>>. Clock variables synchronize events with the importer and across FMUs, they carry the information that a specific event happens.

|`c`+`d`
|A set of continuous-time and discrete-time variables.

|`u`
|Intermediate variables: a set of variables accessible in <<IntermediateUpdateMode>>. In Co-simulation, these variables are continuous-time variables.

|`start`
|A variable at the start time of the simulation as defined by the argument <<startTime>> of <<fmi3EnterInitializationMode>>.

|`attribute=value`
|A set of variables which have an XML attribute-value combination as defined.
_[Example:_ latexmath:[\mathbf{v}_{\mathit{initial=exact}}] _are variables defined with attribute <<initial>> = <<exact>> (see <<definition-of-model-variables>>).]_

|====

At every event instant latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_i], continuous-time variables might change discontinuously (see <<figure-piecewise-continuous-variables>>).

.Piecewise-continuous variables of an FMU: continuous-time (latexmath:[\mathbf{v}_c]), discrete-time (latexmath:[\mathbf{v}_d]) and clocked (latexmath:[\mathbf{v}_k]).

|Variable
|Description

a|latexmath:[\mathbf{t}]
a|<<independent>> variable _[typically: time]_ latexmath:[\in \mathbb{T}].
This variable is defined with <<causality>> = <<independent>>.
All other variables are functions of this independent variable.

For Co-Simulation and Scheduled Execution:

* The i-th communication point is denoted as latexmath:[\mathbf{t}_i]. +
* The communication step size is denoted as latexmath:[\mathbf{h}_i = \mathbf{t}_{i+1} - \mathbf{t}_i]. +

|latexmath:[\mathbf{v}]
|A vector of all exposed variables (all variables defined in element `<ModelVariables>`, see <<definition-of-model-variables>>).
A subset of the variables is selected via a subscript.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{p}]
|Parameters.
The symbol without a subscript references <<parameter,`parameters`>> (variables with <<causality>> = <<parameter>>).
A subset of the variables is selected via a subscript.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{u}]
|Input variables.
The values of these variables are defined outside of the model.
Variables of this type are defined with attribute <<causality>> = <<input>>.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{y}] +
latexmath:[\mathbf{y^{(j)}}]
|Output variables.
The values of these variables are computed in the FMU and they are designed to be used outside the FMU.
Variables of this type are defined with attribute <<causality>> = <<output>>.
For CS and SE: Also j-th derivatives latexmath:[\mathbf{y}^{(j)}(\mathbf{t}_{i+1})] can be provided if supported by the FMU.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{w}]
|Local variables of the FMU that must not be used for FMU connections.
Variables of this type are defined with attribute <<causality>> = <<local>>.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{z}]
|A vector of floating point continuous-time variables representing the event indicators used to define <<state event,`state events`>>.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_c] +
latexmath:[\mathbf{\dot{x}}_c]
|A vector of floating point continuous-time variables representing the continuous-time <<state,`states`>>. +
A vector of floating point continuous-time variables representing the first derivatives of the continuous-time <<state,`states`>>.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d] +
latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d]
|latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d] is a vector of (internal) discrete-time variables (of any type) representing the discrete-time states. +
latexmath:[{}^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d] is the value of latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d] at the previous super-dense time instant. +

|latexmath:[\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{next}}]
|At an event instant, an FMU can define the next time instant latexmath:[\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{next}}], at which the next time event occurs (see also the definition of <<EventMode,events>>).
Every event removes automatically a previous definition of latexmath:[\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{next}}], and it must be explicitly defined again, even if a previously defined latexmath:[\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{next}}] was not yet reached (see <<fmi3UpdateDiscreteStates>>).

|[[relations,relations]] latexmath:[\mathbf{r}]
|A vector of Boolean variables representing relations: latexmath:[\mathbf{r}_j := \mathbf{z}_j > 0].
When entering <<ContinuousTimeMode>> all relations reported via the event indicators latexmath:[\mathbf{z}] are fixed and during this mode these relations are replaced by latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{r}].
Only during <<InitializationMode>> or <<EventMode>> the domains latexmath:[\mathbf{z}_j > 0] can change.
_[For more details, see <<frozen-relations,Remark 3>> below.]_

|[[buffers,buffers]] latexmath:[\mathbf{b}]
|A number of hidden data the FMU for Model Exchange needs to manage during <<ContinuousTimeMode>>. _[For example, delay buffers]_.
