=== Description Schema [[basic-co-simulation-schema]]

This is defined in <<fmi-description-schema>>.
Additionally, the Co-Simulation specific element `Implementation` is defined in the next section.

//TODO: find better place for attribute description!
//TODO: check wording "slave"

If the XML file defines an FMU for Basic Co-Simulation, element `BasicCoSimulation` must be present.
It is defined as:

image::images/schema/BasicCoSimulation.png[width=80%, align="center"]

These attributes have the following meaning (all attributes are optional with exception of `modelIdentifier`):

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|====
|Attribute
|Description

|`modelIdentifier`
|Short class name according to C syntax, for example, `A_B_C`.
Used as prefix for FMI functions if the functions are provided in C source code or in static libraries, but not if the functions are provided by a DLL/SharedObject.
`modelIdentifier` is also used as name of the static library or DLL/SharedObject.
See also <<header-files-and-naming-of-functions>>.

|`needsExecutionTool`
|If `true`, a tool is needed to execute the model.
The FMU just contains the communication to this tool (see <<figure-co-simulation-with-tool-coupling>>).
_[Typically, this information is only utilized for information purposes._
_For example, a Co-Simulation master can inform the user that a tool has to be available on the computer where the slave is instantiated._
_The name of the tool can be taken from the attribute `generationTool` in `<fmiModelDescription>`.]_

|`canBeInstantiatedOnlyOncePerProcess`
|This flag indicates cases (especially for embedded code), where only one instance per FMU is possible.
(For multiple instantiation the default is `false`; if multiple instances are needed, the FMUs must be instantiated in different processes.).

|`canGetAndSetFMUState`
|If `true`, the environment can inquire the internal FMU state and restore it.
That is, <<fmi3GetFMUState>>, <<fmi3SetFMUState>>, and <<fmi3FreeFMUState>> are supported by the FMU.

|`canSerializeFMUState`
|If `true`, the environment can serialize the internal FMU state, in other words, <<fmi3SerializedFMUStateSize>>, <<fmi3SerializeFMUState>>, <<fmi3DeSerializeFMUState>> are supported by the FMU.
If this is the case, then flag `canGetAndSetFMUState` must be `true` as well.

|`providesDirectionalDerivative`
|If `true`, the directional derivative of the equations at communication points can be computed with `fmi3GetDirectionalDerivative`.

|`canInterpolateInputs`
|The slave is able to interpolate <<continuous>> <<input,`inputs`>>.
Calling of `fmi3SetInputDerivatives` has an effect for the slave.

|`maxOutputDerivativeOrder`
|The slave is able to provide <<derivative,`derivatives`>> of <<output,`outputs`>> with maximum order.
Calling of `fmi3GetOutputDerivatives` is allowed up to the order defined by `maxOutputDerivativeOrder`.

|`canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`
|The slave can handle variable communication step size.
The communication step size (argument communicationStepSize of <<fmi3DoStep>>) has not to be constant for each call.

|`providesIntermediateVariableAccess`
|The slave is able to provide access to selected variables during callback function call <<intermediateUpdate>>.
The accessible variables are marked with attribute <<intermediateAccess,`intermediateAccess = fmi3True`>>.

|<<canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate>>
|If `true`, the slave is able to return early from <<fmi3DoStep>> if the master calls <<fmi3DoEarlyReturn>> in callback <<intermediateUpdate>> and <<canReturnEarly,`canReturnEarly = fmi3True`>>.
_[If set to `true`, a Co-Simulation FMU supports ending <<fmi3DoStep>> before the planned next communication point._
_This can be used by the simulation master to avoid unnecessary computations and roll backs of the FMU due to external events known by the simulation master.]_

|`fixedInternalStepSize`
|The fixed internal step size of the FMU (optional).
_[This information can be used by the co-simulation master to synchronize the communication interval with the internal step size of the FMU._
_The co-simulation master should calculate the communication points by multiplying (`number_of_steps * step_size`) instead of repeatedly incrementing (`time += step_size`) to avoid the accumulation of numerical errors.]_
|====

The flags have the following default values. +
boolean: `false` +
unsignedInt: `0` +

Note that if `needsExecutionTool = true`, then it is required that the original tool is available to be executed during co-simulation.
If `needsExecutionTool = false`, the slave is completely contained inside the FMU in source code or binary format (DLL/SharedObject).

==== Example XML Description File [[xml-example-co-simulation]]

The example below is the same as shown in <<xml-example-model-exchange>> for a Model Exchange FMU.
The only difference is the replacement of the element `<ModelExchange>` with the element `<BasicCoSimulation>` (with additional attributes) and the removal of <<local>> variables, which are associated with continuous <<state,`states`>> and their <<derivative,`derivatives`>>.
The XML file may have the following content:

==== Early Return from Current Communication Step

The simulation master collects the information about the capability of an FMU to perform an early return by analyzing the `modelDescription.xml` as defined in <<fmi-description-schema>> and <<fmi-for-basic-co-simulation>>.

===== Co-Simulation FMU
In order to support the early return in <<fmi3DoStep>> the capability flag  <<canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate>> in the XML should be `true`.

===== Example XML Description File

Here is an example of an XML of an FMU supporting early return.
