=== Code Examples
==== Co-Simulation

In the following example, the usage of the FMI functions is sketched in order to clarify the typical calling sequence of the functions in a simulation environment.
We consider two FMUs, where both have one <<continuous>> floating point <<input>> and one <<continuous>> floating point <<output>> which are connected in the following way:

.Connection graph of FMUs.

We assume no algebraic dependency between input and <<output>> of each FMU.
The code demonstrates the simplest importer as shown in <<state-machine-co-simulation>>:

- Constant communication step size.
- No repeating of communication steps.
- The error handling is implemented in a very rudimentary way.
