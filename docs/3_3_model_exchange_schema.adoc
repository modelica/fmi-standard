=== Description Schema [[model-exchange-schema]]

The common XML elements and attributes are defined in <<fmi-description-schema>>.
Additional elements and attributes are defined subsequently.
If the FMU implements the Model Exchange interface type, the element `<ModelExchange>` must be present.
It is defined as:

image::images/schema/ModelExchange.png[width=80%, align="center"]

The attributes in the following table are defined on top of the <<common-capability-flags, common attributes>> and have the following meaning (all attributes are optional with exception of `modelIdentifier`):

|Description

|`modelIdentifier`
|Short class name according to C syntax, for example, `A_B_C`.
Used as prefix for FMI functions if the functions are provided in C source code or in static libraries, but not if the functions are provided by a DLL/SharedObject.
`modelIdentifier` is also used as name of the static library or DLL/SharedObject.
See also <<header-files-and-naming-of-functions>>.

|`completedIntegratorStepNotNeeded`
|If `true`, function <<fmi3CompletedIntegratorStep>> need not be called (this gives a slightly more efficient integration).
If it is called, it has no effect. +
If `false` (the default), the function must be called after every completed integrator step, see <<evaluation-of-model-equations>>.
