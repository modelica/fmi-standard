*Abstract*
// TODO: fix formatting of "Abstract" to be similar to the rest of the large headings

// basics
The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a free standard that defines a container and an interface to exchange dynamic models using a combination of XML files, binaries and C code zipped into a single file.
It is supported by https://fmi-standard.org/tools/[100+ tools] and maintained as a Modelica Association Project.

// TODO add motivation for FMI: 2, max 3, sentences


// pointers
The https://fmi-standard.org/downloads/[downloads page] provides this specification, as well as supporting C header and XML schema files.
In addition, sample models (exported from different tools in FMI format) are provided to assist tool vendors to ensure compatibility with other tools, as well as a test suite to check whether connected FMUs (Function Mock-up Units) are appropriately handled by a tool.
