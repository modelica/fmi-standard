This document defines the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI), version 2.0.4. This is a maintenance release for FMI 2.0.
FMI is a tool-independent standard to support both model exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models using a combination of XML files and C code (either compiled in DLL/shared libraries or in source code).
The first version, FMI 1.0, was published in 2010.
The FMI development was initiated by Daimler AG with the goal to improve the exchange of simulation models between suppliers and OEMs.
As of today, development of the standard continues through the participation of many companies and research institutes.
FMI 2.0 is supported by over 100 tools and is used by automotive and non-automotive organizations throughout Europe, Asia and North America.

The downloads page (https://fmi-standard.org/downloads/) provides, this specification, as well as supporting C header and XML schema files, and an FMI compliance checker.
In addition, sample models (exported from different tools in FMI format) are provided to assist tool vendors to ensure compatibility with other tools, as well as a test suite to check whether connected FMUs (Function Mock-up Units) are appropriately handled by a tool.

**Abstract**

This document defines the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI),
version 2.0.4 to (a) exchange dynamic models between tools and (b) define tool
coupling for dynamic system simulation environments.

_FMI for Model Exchange (chapter 3)_

The intention is that a modeling environment can generate a C code representation of
a dynamic system model that can be utilized by other modeling and simulation environments.
Models are described by differential,
algebraic and discrete equations with time-, state- and step-events.
If the C code describes a continuous system,
this system is solved with the integrators of the environment where it is used.
The models to be treated by this interface can be large for usage in offline or online simulation,
or they can be used in embedded control systems on microprocessors.

_FMI for Co-Simulation (chapter 4)_

The intention is to provide an interface standard for coupling
of simulation tools in a co-simulation environment.
The data exchange between subsystems is restricted to discrete communication points.
In the time between two communication points,
the subsystems are solved independently from each other by their individual solver.
Master algorithms control the data exchange between subsystems and the
synchronization of all simulation solvers (slaves).
Simple master algorithms,
as well as more sophisticated ones are both supported.
Note that the master algorithm itself is not part of the FMI standard.

_FMI Common Concepts (chapter 2)_

The two interface standards have many parts in common.
In particular, it is possible to utilize several
instances of a model and/or a co-simulation tool and to connect them together.
The interfaces are independent of the target environment because no header files
are used that depend on the target environment
(with exception of the data types of the target platform).
This allows generating one dynamic link library that can be utilized in any environment on the same platform.
A model, a cosimulation slave or the coupling part of a tool,
is distributed in one ZIP file called FMU (Functional Mockup Unit) that contains several files:

. An XML file contains the definitions of all exposed variables in the FMU and other static information.
It is then possible to run the FMU on a target system without this information,
in other words with no unnecessary overhead.

. All required model equations or the access to co-simulation tools are provided with a small set of easy-to-use C functions.
A new caching technique allows a more efficient evaluation of
the model equations than in other approaches.
These C functions can either be provided in source and/or binary form.
Binary forms for different platforms can be included in the same FMU ZIP file.

. The model equations or the co-simuation tool can be either provided directly in the FMU,
or the FMU contains only a generic communication module that communicates
with an external tool that evaluates or simulates the model.
In the XML file, information about the capabilities of the FMU are present,
for example to characterize the ability of a co-simulation slave to support advanced master algorithms such as the usage of variable communication step sizes,
higher order signal extrapolation, or others.

. Further data can be included in the FMU ZIP file,
especially a model icon (bitmap file),
documentation files,
maps and tables needed by the FMU,
and/or all object libraries or dynamic link libraries that are
utilized.

A growing set of tools supports FMI.

**About FMI 2.0.4**

FFMI 2.0.4 is a maintenance release.
FMUs created according to FMI 2.0.4 are valid FMUs according to FMI 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2 and 2.0.3. 
FMI 2.0.4 contains small bugfixes and two backports from FMI 3.0: 
•	Terminals and Icons
•	Build configuration
These are new features compared to FMI 2.0.3, but are “orthogonal” extensions that do not interfere with FMI 2.0 behaviour.


**About FMI 2.0.3**

FMI 2.0.3 is a maintenance release with no new functional changes compared to FMI 2.0 or 2.0.1. +
FMUs created according to FMI 2.0.2 are valid FMUs according to FMI 2.0 or 2.0.1.
FMI 2.0.3 introducesminor clarifications that are mainly findings from the FMI3.0 development.

**About FMI 2.0.2**

FMI 2.0.2 is a maintenance release with no new functional changes compared to FMI 2.0 or 2.0.1. +
FMUs created according to FMI 2.0.2 are valid FMUs according to FMI 2.0 or 2.0.1.
FMI 2.0.2. introduces the “/extra” directory as a standardized place to provide additional information for and FMU according to layered standards. +
This is does not change the behavior of the FMU and clarifies the storage location for additional files (even after the creation of the FMU), e.g., required by layered standards.


**About FMI 2.0.1**

FMI 2.0.1 is a maintenance release with no new features compared to FMI 2.0. FMUs created according to FMI 2.0.1 are valid FMUs according to FMI 2.0.

**About FMI 2.0**

FMI 2.0 was a major enhancement to FMI 1.0, that merges the FMI 1.0 Model Exchange and
Co-Simulation standards and incorporates many improvements, often due to practical experience when using the FMI 1.0 standards.
New features are usually optional
(need neither be supported by the tool that exports an FMU, nor by the tool that imports an FMU).
Details are provided in appendix A.3.1.


**Conventions used in this Document**

* Non-normative text is given in square brackets in italic font: _[Especially examples are defined in this style.]_

* Arrays appear in two forms:

** In the end-user/logical view, one- and two-dimensional arrays are used.
Here the convention of linear algebra,
the control community and the most important tools in this area is utilized.
In other words the first element along one dimension starts at index one.
In all these cases,
the starting index is also explicitly mentioned at the respective definition of the array.
For example,
in the modelDescription.xml file,
the set of exposed variables is defined as ordered sets where the first
element is referenced with index one
(these indices are, for example,
used to define the sparseness structure of partial derivative matrices).

** In the implementation view, one-dimensional C arrays are used.
In order to access an array element the C convention is used.
For example,
the first element of input argument `x` for function `setContinuousStates(..)` is `x[0]`.

** _[Clarification for FMI 2.0.2: In the structured naming convention both 0- and 1-based array indexing is allowed.]_
