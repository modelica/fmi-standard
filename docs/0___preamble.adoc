This document defines the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI), version 3.0.
This is a major release with new features compared to FMI 2.0.

FMI is a tool-independent standard to support both model exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models using a combination of XML files and C code (either compiled in DLL/shared libraries or in source code).
The first version, FMI 1.0, was published in 2010.
The FMI development was initiated by Daimler AG with the goal to improve the exchange of simulation models between suppliers and OEMs.
As of today, development of the standard continues through the participation of many companies and research institutes.
FMI 2.0 is supported by over 100 tools and is used by automotive and non-automotive organizations throughout Europe, Asia and North America.

The downloads page (https://fmi-standard.org/downloads/) provides, this specification, as well as supporting C header and XML schema files, and an FMI compliance checker.
In addition, sample models (exported from different tools in FMI format) are provided to assist tool vendors to ensure compatibility with other tools, as well as a test suite to check whether connected FMUs (Function Mock-up Units) are appropriately handled by a tool.

**Abstract**

This document defines the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI),
version 3.0 to (a) exchange dynamic models between tools and (b) define tool
coupling for dynamic system simulation environments.

_FMI for Basic Co-Simulation (BCS) (<<fmi-for-basic-co-simulation>>)_

The intention is to provide an interface standard for coupling
of simulation models or tools in a co-simulation environment.
The data exchange between subsystems is largely restricted to discrete communication points.
In the time between two communication points,
the subsystems are solved independently by internal means, see below.
Master algorithms control the data exchange and the
synchronization between subsystems (FMUs).

Note that the master algorithm itself is not part of the FMI standard.

_FMI for Hybrid Co-Simulation (HCS) (<<fmi-for-hybrid-co-simulation>>)_

The Hybrid Co-Simulation interface adds a number of features primarily to allow for more sophisticated master algorithms that aim at more efficient and robust simulations.
Such additional features are raising events between communication time points using synchronous and asynchronous clocks or sharing values between communication points to allow for improved interpolation of data.
The master algorithm is responsible for:
* advancing the overall simulation time, and
* triggering execution of synchronous and asynchronous external events for a set of FMUs, and
* handling events (e.g. clock ticks) signaled by the FMUs.

For both Basic Co-Simulation and Hybrid Co-Simulation the master algorithm is shielded from how the subsystem FMU advances time internally.
For example, FMUs containing ODEs and exposing either of the co-simulation interfaces require to include an ODE solver inside the FMU to internally advance time between the communication points.
Or, for controller code packaged as FMU, an internal scheduling algorithm will trigger tasks at the correct time and order while advancing time to the next communication point or event.

_FMI for Model Exchange (ME) (<<fmi-for-model-exchange>>)_

The Model Exchange interface exposes an ODE to an external solver of an importing tool's master algorithm.
Models are described by differential, algebraic and discrete equations with time-, state- and step-events.
That master algorithm, usually a DAE solver, is responsible to advance time, set states and handle events etc.

_FMI for Scheduled Co-Simulation (SCS) (<<fmi-for-scheduled-co-simulation>>)_

The Scheduled Co-Simulation interface exposes individual parts of a model or tasks of a control algorithm to be called from an external scheduler of an importing tool's master algorithm.
The master algorithm is responsible for:
* advancing the overall simulation time, and
* triggering execution of synchronous and asynchronous external events for all exposed model parts of a set of FMUs (e.g. tasks of a controller model), and
* handling events (e.g. clock ticks) signaled by the FMUs.

In many ways, the Scheduled Co-Simulation interface is the equivalent of the Model Exchange interface: the first externalizes a scheduling algorithm usually found in a controller algorithm and the second interface externalizes the ODE solver.

_FMI for Co-Simulation (xCS)_

Any reference to all three Co-Simulation interfaces (BCS, HCS and SCS) are referred to as Co-Simulation interface, or xCS.
Writing lower-case co-simulation refers to the general concept of co-simulation.

_FMI Common Concepts (<<fmi-common-concepts>>)_

The four interface standards have many parts in common.
In particular, it is possible to utilize several instances of a model and/or a co-simulation tool and to connect them together.
The interfaces are independent of the target environment because no header files are used that depend on the target environment (with exception of the data types of the target platform).
This allows generating one dynamic link library that can be utilized in any environment on the same platform.
A model, a co-simulation slave or the coupling part of a tool, is distributed in one ZIP file called FMU (Functional Mockup Unit) that contains several files:

. An XML file contains the definitions of all exposed variables in the FMU and other static information.
It is then possible to run the FMU on a target system without this information, in other words with no unnecessary overhead.

. All required model equations or the access to co-simulation tools are provided with a small set of easy-to-use C functions.
A new caching technique allows a more efficient evaluation of the model equations than in other approaches.
These C functions can either be provided in source and/or binary form.
Binary forms for different platforms can be included in the same FMU ZIP file.

. The model equations or the co-simuation tool can be either provided directly in the FMU,
or the FMU contains only a generic communication module that communicates with an external tool that evaluates or simulates the model.
In the XML file, also information about the capabilities of the FMU are present, for example to characterize the ability of a Co-Simulation slave to support advanced master algorithms such as the usage of variable communication step sizes, higher order signal extrapolation, or others.

. Further data can be included in the FMU ZIP file, especially a model icon (bitmap file), documentation files, maps and tables needed by the FMU, and/or all object libraries or dynamic link libraries that are utilized.

**About FMI 2.0.1**

FMI 2.0.1 was a maintenance release with no new features compared to FMI 2.0.
FMUs created according to FMI 2.0.1 are valid FMUs according to FMI 2.0.

**About FMI 2.0**

FMI 2.0 was a major enhancement to FMI 1.0, that merged the FMI 1.0 Model Exchange and Co-Simulation standards and incorporates many improvements, often due to practical experience when using the FMI 1.0 standards.
New features are usually optional (need neither be supported by the tool that exports an FMU, nor by the tool that imports an FMU).
Details are provided in appendix A.3.1.

**Conventions used in this Document**

* Non-normative text is given in square brackets in italic font: _[Especially examples are defined in this style.]_

* Arrays appear in two forms:

** In the end-user/logical view, one- and two-dimensional arrays are used.
Here the convention of linear algebra, the control community and the most important tools in this area is utilized.
In other words the first element along one dimension starts at index one.
In all these cases, the starting index is also explicitly mentioned at the respective definition of the array.
For example, in the `modelDescription.xml` file, the set of exposed variables is defined as ordered sets where the first element is referenced with index one (these indices are, for example, used to define the sparseness structure of partial derivative matrices).

** In the implementation view, one-dimensional C arrays are used.
In order to access an array element the C convention is used.
For example, the first element of input argument `x` for function `setContinuousStates` is `x[0]`.

* The key words *MUST*, *MUST NOT*, *REQUIRED*, *SHALL*, *SHALL NOT*, *SHOULD*, *SHOULD NOT*, *RECOMMENDED*, *NOT RECOMMENDED*, *MAY*, and *OPTIONAL* in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

* `{VariableType}` is used as a placeholder for all variable type names without the `fmi3` prefix (e.g. `fmi3Get{VariableType}` stands for `fmi3GetUInt8` etc.).
