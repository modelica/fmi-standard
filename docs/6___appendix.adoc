## FMI Revision History

This appendix describes the history of the FMI design and its
contributors. The current version of this document is available from
https://fmi-standard.org/.

The Functional Mock-up Interface development was initiated and organized
by Daimler AG (from Bernd Relovsky and others) as subproject inside the
http://www.itea2.org/[ITEA2] MODELISAR project.

The development of versions 1.0 and 2.0 was performed within WP200 of
MODELISAR, organized by the WP200 work package leader Dietmar Neumerkel
from Daimler.

### A.1 Version 1.0 – FMI for Model Exchange

Version 1.0 of FMI for Model Exchange was released on Jan. 26, 2010.

### A.3 Version 2.0 – FMI for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation

FMI 2.0 for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation was released on July 25, 2014.

#### A.3.1 Overview

This section gives an overview about the changes with respect to versions 1.0 for Model Exchange and 1.0 for Co-Simulation:

* FMI 2.0 is not backwards compatible to FMI 1.0.

* The documents, schema and header files for Model Exchange and for Co-Simulation have been merged. Due to the merging, some conflicts had to be resolved leading to some non-backwards compatible changes with respect to FMI 1.0.

* Parameters can be declared to be "tunable" in the FMU, in other words, during simulation these parameters can be changed (if supported by the simulation environment).

* When enabling logging, log categories to be logged can be defined, so that the FMU only needs to generate logs of the defined categories (in FMI 1.0, logs had to be generated for all log categories and they had to be filtered afterwards). Log categories that are supported by an FMU can be optionally defined in the XML file so that a simulation environment can provide them to the user for selection.

* In order that tools can more simply support importing both FMI 1.0 and 2.0, all file and function names of FMI 2.0 start with `fmi2`, whereas they start with `fmi` for FMI 1.0.

* FMI function names are no longer prefixed with the `modelIdentifier` if used in a DLL/sharedObject. As a result, FMUs that need a tool can use a generic communication DLL, and the loading of DLLs is no longer FMU dependent.

* The different modes of an FMU are now clearly signaled with respective function calls (`fmi2EnterInitializationMode`, `fmi2EnterEventMode`, `fmi2EnterContinuousTimeMode`).

* The interfaces have been redesigned, in order that algebraic loops over connected FMUs with Real, Integer, or Boolean unknowns can now be handled reasonably not only in Continuous Time Mode, but also in Initialization and Event Mode. In FMI 1.0, algebraic loops in Initialization and Even Mode could not be handled.

* The termination of every global event iteration over connected FMUs must be reported by a new function call (`fmi2EnterContinuousTimeMode`).

* The unit definitions have been improved: The tool-specific unit-name can optionally be expressed as function of the 7 SI base units and the SI derived unit "rad". It is then possible to check units when FMUs are connected together (without standardizing unit names), or to convert variable values that are provided in different units (for the same physical quantity).

* Enumerations have an arbitrary (but unique) mapping to integers (in FMI 1.0, the mapping was automatically to 1,2,3,...).

* The alias/negatedAlias variable definitions have been removed, to simplify the interface: If variables of the same base type (like `fmi2Real`) have the same valueReference, they have identical values. A simulation environment may ignore this completely (this was not possible in FMI 1.0), or can utilize this information to more efficiently store results on file.

* When instantiating an FMU, the absolute path to the FMU resource directory is now reported also in Model Exchange, in order that the FMU can read all of its resources (for example, maps, tables, ...) independently of the "current directory" of the simulation environment where the FMU is used.

* An ordering is defined for input, output, and state variables in the XML file of an FMU, in order for this order to be defined in the FMU, and not be (arbitrarily) selected by the simulation environment. This is essential, for example, when linearizing an FMU, or when providing "sparsity" information (see below).

* Several optional features have been added:

** The complete FMU state can be saved, restored, and serialized to a byte vector (that can be stored on file). As a result, a simulation (both for Model Exchange and for Co-Simulation) can be restarted from a saved FMU state. Rejecting steps for variable step-size Co-Simulation master algorithms is now performed with this feature (instead of the less powerful method of FMI 1.0).

** The dependency of state derivatives and of output variables from inputs and states can be defined in the XML file, in other words, the sparsity pattern for Jacobians can be defined. This allows simulating stiff FMUs with many states (> 1000 states) since sparse matrix methods can be utilized in the numerical integration method. Furthermore, it can be stated whether this dependency is linear (this allows to transform nonlinear algebraic equation systems into linear equation systems when connecting FMUs).

** Directional derivatives can be computed for derivatives of continuous-time states and for outputs. This is useful when partial derivatives of connected FMUs must be computed. If the exported FMU performs this computation analytically, then all numerical algorithms based on these partial derivatives (for example, the numerical integration method or nonlinear algebraic solvers) are more efficient and more reliable.

** Every scalar variable definition can have an additional "annotation" data structure that is arbitrary ("any" element in XML). A tool vendor can store tool-dependent information here (that other tools can ignore), for example, to store the graphical layout of parameter menus. The `VendorAnnotations` element was also generalized from (name, value) pairs to any XML data structure.

* Many smaller improvements have been included, due to the experience in using FMI 1.0 (for example, the causality/variability attributes have been changed and more clearly defined, the fmi2ModelFunctions.h header has been split into two header files (one for the function signature, and one for the function names), in order that the header files can be directly used both for DLLs and for source code distribution).

#### A.3.2 Main changes

This section gives the details about the changes with respect to versions 1.0 for Model Exchange and 1.0 for Co-Simulation:

In this version, the documents of version 1.0 for Model Exchange and for Co-Simulation have been merged and several new features have been added.

*The following changes in FMI 2.0 are [underline]#not backwards compatible# due to the merging*:

[role=second-indented]
File fmiModelTypes.h (in FMI for Model Exchange) has been renamed to fmi2TypesPlatform.h (the file name used in FMI for Co-Simulation).

[role=second-indented]
File fmiModelFunctions.h (in FMI for Model Exchange) has been renamed to fmi2Functions.h (the file name used in FMI for Co-Simulation), and the function prototypes in this header files have been merged from "Model Exchange" and from "Co-Simulation"). Additionally, a new header files has been added, `fmi2FunctionTypes.h` that contains a definition of the function signatures. This header file is also used in `fmi2Functions.h` (so the signature is not duplicated). The benefit is that `fmi2FunctionTypes.h` can be directly used when loading a DLL/sharedObject (in FMI 1.0, the tool providers had to provide this header file by themselves).

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #47: +
In FMI 1.0 for Model Exchange the fmiModelDescription.version was
defined as string, whereas in Co-Simulation it was defined as integer.
This has been changed, so that version is a string.

*The following [underline]#backwards compatible# improvements have been made in FMI 2.0:*

The FMI 1.0 documents have been merged (for example, all common definitions have been placed in the new chapter 2).

*The following [underline]#not backwards compatible# improvements have been made in FMI 2.0:*

[role=second-indented]
Element "fmiModelDescription.Implementation" in the model description schema file has been replaced by a different structure where one hierarchical level is removed. There are now 2 elements directly under fmiModelDescription: "ModelExchange" and "CoSimulation". +
File "fmiImplementation.xsd" has been removed. +
New capability flags have been introduced both for `ModelExchange` and for `CoSimulation`, such as `canGetAndSetFMUstate`, `canSerializeFMUstate`, etc. +
Attribute `modelIdentifier` has been moved from an `fmiModelDescription` attribute to an attribute in `ModelExchange` and in `CoSimulation`. This allows providing different identifiers, and then an FMU may contain both distribution types with different DLL names (which correspond to the `modelIdentifier` names). +
A new attribute `needsExecutionTool` has been introduced both in `ModelExchange` and in `CoSimulation` in order to define whether a tool is needed to execute the FMU. The previous elements in `CoSimulation_Tool` have been removed.

[role=second-indented]
The state machines of ModelExchange and CoSimulation have been improved. Especially, the entering of the states in this state machine are now clearly marked by corresponding function calls (`fmi2EnterInitializationMode`, `fmi2EnterEventMode`, `fmi2EnterContinuousTimeMode`).

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #9: +
A new element `LogCategory` was introduced in `fmiModelDescription`. This is an unordered set of strings representing the possible values of the log categories of the FMU (for example, `logEvent`). +
Function `fmi2SetDebugLogging` has two new arguments to define the categories (from `LogCategory`) to be used in log messages.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #33: +
The `causality` and `variability` attributes of a `ScalarVariable` have not been fully clear. This has been fixed by changing the enumeration values of variability from `"constant, parameter, discrete, continuous"` to `"constant, fixed, tunable, discrete, continuous"` and causality from `"input output internal none"` to `"parameter, input, output, local"`. This change includes now also the support of parameters that can be tuned (changed) during simulation.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #35: +
In order to simplify implementation (for example, an "element event handler" is no longer needed in SAX XML parser), the only location where data is not defined by attributes, is changed to an attribute definition: Element `DirectDependency` in `ScalarVariable` is removed. The same information can now be obtained from the `InputDependency` attribute inside `<fmiModelDescription><ModelStructure><Outputs>`.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #37: +
The new status flag `fmi2Terminate` is added to the Co-Simulation definition. This allows a slave to terminate the simulation run before the stop time is reached without triggering an error.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #39: +
Wrong example in the previous section 2.10 of Co-Simulation has been fixed.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #41: +
New types introduced in fmi2TypesPlatform.h : +
`fmi2ComponentEnvironment`, `fmi2FMUstate`, `fmi2Byte`. +
Struct `fmi2CallbackFunctions` gets a new last argument: +
`fmi2ComponentEnvironment componentEnvironment` +
The first argument of function `logger` is changed from type `fmi2Component`
to `fmi2ComponentEnvironment`. +
By these changes, a pointer to a data structure from the simulation environment is passed to the `logger` and allows the `logger`, for example, to transform a `valueReference` in the log message to a variable name.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #42: +
Enumerations defined in fmi2Type.xsd are now defined with (name, value) pairs. An enumeration value must be unique within the same enumeration (to have a bijective mapping between enumeration names and values, in order that results can optionally be presented with names and not with values). +
Furthermore, the `min/max` values of element `Enumeration` in `TypeDefinition` have been removed because they are meaningless.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #43: +
The previous header file fmiFunctions.h is split into 2 header files, fmi2FunctionTypes.h and fmi2Functions.h, in order to simplify the dynamic loading of an FMU (the typedefs of the function prototypes defined in fmi2FunctionTypes.h can be used to type case the function pointers of the dynamic loading).

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #45: +
Contrary to the ticket proposal, no new function `fmiResetModel` is added. Instead 6 new functions are added to get and set the internal FMU state via a pointer and to serialize and deserialize an FMU state via a byte vector provided by the environment. For details, see section 2.1.8. This feature allows, for example, to support more sophisticated co-simulation master algorithms which require the repetition of communication steps. Additionally, two capability flags have been added (`canGetAndSetFMUstate`, `canSerializeFMUstate`) in order to define whether these features are supported by the FMU.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #46: +
The unit definitions have been enhanced by providing an optional mapping to the 7 SI base units and the SI derived unit `"rad"`, in order for a tool to be able to check whether a signal provided to the FMU or inquired by the FMU has the expected unit.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #48: +
The definition of `fmiBoolean` in `fmiTypesPlatform.h` for `"standard32"` was changed from `char` to `int`. The main reason is to avoid unnecessary casting of Boolean types when exporting an FMU from a Modelica environment or when importing it into a Modelica environment. +
The current definition of `char` for a Boolean was not meaningful, since, for example, for embedded code generation usually Booleans are packed on integers and `char` for one Boolean would also not be used. It is planned to add more supported data types to an FMU in the future, which should then also include support for packed Booleans.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #49: +
Argument `fmiComponent` in function pointer `stepFinished` was changed to `fmi2ComponentEnvironment` (when `stepFinished` is called from a co-simulation slave and provides `fmi2ComponentEnvironment`, then this data structure provided by the environment can provide environment specific data to efficiently identify the slave that called the function).

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #54: +
In section 2.3 it is now stated, that the FMU must include all referenced resources. This means especially that for Microsoft VisualStudio the option "MT" has to be used when constructing a DLL in order to include the run-time environment of VisualStudio in the DLL.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #75: +
Since states are now explicitly defined in the XML file, function `fmiGetStateValueReferences` is no longer needed, as well as the special type `fmiUndefinedValueReference` that might be used as return value of this function. Therefore, both elements have been removed in FMI 2.0.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #85: +
New argument `noSetFMUStatePriorToCurrentPoint` to function `fmi2CompletedIntegratorStep`, similarly to `fmi2DoStep`, in order that the FMU can flush a result buffer if necessary.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #86: +
The fmi2TypesPlatform.h header file has been slightly changed: The default value of `fmi2TypesPlatform` is changed from `"standard32"` to `"default"`, since this definition holds for most platforms and compilers. Furthermore, the default type of `fmi2ValueReference` has been changed from `unsigned int` to `size_t`.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #88: +
The definition of fmi2Functions.h slightly changed to improve portability (the header file can now be utilized both for Microsoft and gnu compilers, and the danger of name conflicts has been reduced).

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #95: +
FMI XML files need to be UTF-8 encoded (as are XML schema files and strings in the C-API), in order to simplify reading of XML files.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #113: +
Changed function name `fmiTerminateSlave` to `fmi2Terminate` in order to be consistent with the other function definitions (`fmi2EnterSlaveInitializationMode`, `fmi2Terminate`).

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #115: +
Clarification added, that the special values `NAN`, `+INF`, `-INF`, are not allowed in the FMI XML files.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #127: +
Added clarifications in section 2.1, that all C-API functions are not thread safe and that FMUs must not influence each other.

[role=second-indented]
Fixing ticket #218: +
Changed all name prefixes from `fmi` to `fmi2` in *.h, *.xsd, *.png files and in the specification to avoid compiler and linker problems when supporting both FMI 1.0 and 2.0 in the same program.

[role=second-indented]
Function `fmiInitialize` was split into two functions: `fmi2EnterInitializationMode` and `fmi2ExitInitializationMode` in order that artificial or "real" algebraic loops over connected FMUs can be handled in an efficient way.

[role=second-indented]
Function `stepEvent` in `struct fmi2CallbackFunctions` had different locations in the FMI documentation and in the header file. This inconsistency has been corrected by using the location in the header file (at the end of the `struct`).

[role=second-indented]
The `struct fmi2CallbackFunctions` is provided as a pointer to the `struct` when instantiating an FMU, and not as the `struct` itself. This simplifies the importing of an FMU into a Modelica environment.

[role=second-indented]
Defined how to utilize the `min`/`max` attributes for `fmi2SetReal`, `fmi2SetInteger`, `fmi2GetReal`, `fmi2GetInteger` calls.

[role=second-indented]
Attributes `numberOfScalarVariables`, `numberOfContinuousStates`, `numberOfInputs`, `numberOfOutputs` available in FMI 1.0 have been removed, because they can be deduced from the remaining XML file (so in FMI 2.0 this would have been redundant information).

## Glossary

This glossary is a subset of (_MODELISAR Glossary, 2009_) with some extensions.

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|*Term* |*Description*

|_algorithm_
|A formal recipe for solving a specific type of problem.

|_application programming interface (API)_
|A set of functions, procedures, methods or classes together with type conventions/declarations (for example, C header files) that an operating system, library or service provides to support requests made by computer programs.

|_AUTOSAR_
|AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (http://www.autosar.org/[www.autosar.org]). +
Evolving standard of the automotive industry to define the implementation of embedded systems in vehicles including communication mechanisms.

AUTOSAR is targeted to build on top of the real-time operating system OSEK (http://www.osek-vdx.org/[www.osek-vdx.org], http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSEK[de.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSEK]). The use of the AUTOSAR standard requires AUTOSAR membership.

|_communication points_
|Time grid for data exchange between master and slaves in a co-simulation environment (also known as "sampling points" or "synchronization points").

|_communication step size_
|Distance between two subsequent _communication points_ (also known as "sampling rate" or "macro step size").

|Functional Mock-up Interface for Model Exchange: +
One of the MODELISAR _functional mock-up interfaces._ It consists of the _model description interface_ and the _model execution interface_. +
It connects the _external model_ component with the _solver_ component.

|_FMU_
|Functional Mock-up Unit: +
A "model class" from which one or more "model instances" can be instantiated for simulation. An FMU is stored in one ZIP file as defined in section 2.3 consisting basically of one XML file that defines the model variables and a set of C functions (see section 2.1), in source or binary form, to execute the model equations or the simulator slave. In case of tool execution, additionally, the original simulator is required to perform the co-simulation (compare section 4.3.1)

|_integration algorithm_
|The numerical algorithm to solve differential equations.

|_integrator_
|A _software component_, which implements an _integration algorithm_.

|_interface_
|An abstraction of a _software component_ that describes its behavior without dealing with the internal implementation. _Software components_ communicate with each other via interfaces.

|_master/slave_
|A method of communication, where one device or process has unidirectional control over one or more other devices. Once a master/slave relationship between devices or processes is established, the direction of control is always from the master to the slaves. In some systems a master is elected from a group of eligible devices, with the other devices acting in the role of slaves.

|_mock-up_
|A full-sized structural, but not necessarily functional model built accurately to scale, used chiefly for study, testing, or display. In the context of computer aided design (CAD), a digital mock-up (DMU) means a computer-based representation of the product geometry with its parts, usually in 3-D, for all kinds of geometrical and mechanical analyses.

|_model_
|A model is a mathematical or logical representation of a system of entities, phenomena, or processes. Basically a model is a simplified abstract view of the complex reality. +
It can be used to compute its expected behavior under specified conditions.

|_model description file_
|The model description file is an XML file, which supplies a description of all properties of a _model_ (for example, input/output variables).

|_model description interface_
|An interface description to write or retrieve information from the _model description file_.

|_Model Description Schema_
|An _XML_ schema that defines how all relevant, non-executable, information about a "model class" (_FMU)_ is stored in a text file in _XML_ format. Most important, data for every variable is defined (variable name, handle, data type, variability, unit, etc.), see section 2.2.

|_numerical solver_
|see _solver_

|_output points_
|Tool internal time grid for saving output data to file (in some tools also known as "_communication points_" – but this term is used in a different way in FMI for Co-Simulation, see above).

|_output step size_
|Distance between two subsequent _output points_.

|_parameter_
|A quantity within a _model_, which remains constant during _simulation (fixed parameter) or may change at event instances (tunable parameter)_. Examples are a mass, stiffness, etc.

|_slave_
|see _master/slave_

|_simulation_
|Compute the behavior of one or several _models_ under specified conditions. +
(see also _co-simulation_)

|_simulation model_
|see _model_

|_simulation program_
|Software to develop and/or solve simulation _models_. The software includes a _solver_, may include a user interface and methods for post processing (see also: _simulation tool_, _simulation environment_). +
Examples of simulation programs are: AMESim, Dymola, SIMPACK, SimulationX, SIMULINK.

|_simulation tool_
|see _simulation program_

|_simulator_
|A simulator can include one or more _simulation programs_, which solve a common simulation task.

|_solver_
|_Software component,_ which includes algorithms to solve __model__s, for example, _integration algorithms_ and _event handling_ methods.

|_state_
|The "continuous states" of a model are all variables that appear differentiated in the model and are independent from each other. +
The "discrete states" of a model are time-discrete variables that have two values in a model: The value of the variable from the previous _event_ instant, and the value of the variable at the actual event instant.

|_state event_
|_Event_ that is defined by the time instant where the domain latexmath:[z > 0] of an event indicator variable `z` is changed to latexmath:[z \leq 0], or vice versa. +
This definition is slightly different from the usual standard definition of state events: "latexmath:[z(t)*z(t_{i-1}) \leq 0]" which has the severe drawback that the value of the event indicator at the previous event instant, latexmath:[z(t_{i-1}) \neq 0], must be non-zero and this condition cannot be guaranteed. The often used term "zero crossing function" for `z` is misleading (and is therefore not used in this document), since a state event is defined by a change of a domain and not by a zero crossing of a variable.

|_step event_
|_Event_ that might occur at a completed integrator step. Since this event type is not defined by a precise time or condition, it is usually not defined by a user. A program may use it, for example, to dynamically switch between different states. A step event is handled much more efficiently than a _state event_, because the event is just triggered after performing a check at a completed integrator step, whereas a search procedure is needed for a state event.

|_super dense time_
|A precise definition of time taking into account iterations at an event. For an _FMU_, the independent variable time latexmath:[t \in \mathbb{T}] is a tuple latexmath:[t = (t_R, t_I)] where latexmath:[t_R \in  \mathbb{R}, t_I \in \mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,\ldots\}]. The real part latexmath:[t_R] of this tuple is the independent variable of the FMU for describing the continuous-time behavior of the model between events. In this phase latexmath:[t_I = 0]. The integer part latexmath:[t_I] of this tuple is a counter to enumerate (and therefore distinguish) the events at the same continuous-time instant latexmath:[t_R].

|_time event_
|_Event_ that is defined by a predefined time instant. Since the time instant is known in advance, the integrator can select its step size so that the event point is directly reached. Therefore, this event can be handled efficiently.

|_user interface_
|The part of the simulation program that gives the user control over the simulation and allows watching results.

|_value reference_
|The value of a scalar variable of an FMU is identified with an Integer handle called _value reference_. This handle is defined in the modelDescription.xml file (as attribute `valueReference` in element `ScalarVariable`). Element `valueReference` might not be unique for all variables. If two or more variables of the same base data type (such as `fmi2Real`) have the same `valueReference`, then they have identical values but other parts of the variable definition might be different (for example, min/max attributes).

|_XML_
|eXtensible Markup Language (http://www.w3.org/XML/[www.w3.org/XML], http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML]) – An open standard to store information in text files in a structured form.
