== FMI for Scheduled Execution [[fmi-for-scheduled-execution]]

The <<fmi-for-co-simulation,Co-Simulation>> interface provides an indirect control over the computation of model partitions.
With Scheduled Execution, a simulation algorithm can directly control the time of computation (i.e. scheduling) for such model partitions.

The Scheduled Execution interface addresses simulation use cases with the following requirements:

* At any time (even for unpredictable events), an event can be signaled to an FMU;
* If multiple FMUs share resources (e.g. control tasks), the time requirements (e.g. execution time, communication deadlines) of all model partitions have to be observed and respected;
** Time requirements may exist due to communication constraints (that are not apparent at FMU simulation level) which have to be fulfilled by the simulation algorithm;
** That requires a global evaluation order and preemption policy for all model partitions of the multiple FMUs
** Priority information provided by the FMUs has to be evaluated and merged to an overall priority for available model partitions
* Data shall move between the different FMU model partitions for the same or next activation time.
** Get/set operations must also be possible for the same activation time for different model partitions between the computation of these model partitions.
* The Co-Simulation interface provides support for concurrent computation of model partitions (i.e. a support of multiple rates) on a single computational resource (e.g. CPU-core) of an FMU.
For that a preemptive multitasking regime is intended (cooperative multitasking is not covered by this description).

_[A parallel computation of model partitions is not part of the FMI 3.0 API._
_An FMU may still internally use parallel computation on multiple cores, but handling this is (currently) not part of the FMI standard. Such an internal parallel computation is not visible to the simulation algorithm._
_It is a tool vendor specific solution that has ties to the used OS and the co-simulation environment.]_
