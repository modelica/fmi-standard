== FMI for Scheduled Execution [[fmi-for-scheduled-execution]]

The Scheduled Execution interface provides support for concurrent computation of <<model-partition, model partitions>> on a single computational resource (e.g. CPU-core).
The FMU exposes model partitions defined by its associated Clocks while the <<importer>> is enabled to explicitly schedule each model partition's execution.
As mentioned in <<advancing-time>>, it is the importer respectively its scheduler that controls how time is progressing.

The following use cases and requirements motivate the introduction of this interface type:

* The scheduler can execute a model partition at any time.
It can execute model partitions periodically or reacting to an <<event>> e.g. an event of an external I/O or an event sent from an FMU (see below).
* The scheduler can run model partitions of one FMU together with model partitions of other FMUs or model partitions provided by other sources such as other models or functions in a single process.
* The scheduler regards <<priority, priorities>> of the model partitions defined by the FMU.
* The Scheduled Execution interface allows the scheduler to preempt the execution of an FMU's model partition.
The <<importer>> is providing lock/unlock functions to the FMU to secure sections that should not be interrupted (e.g. the exchange of data between two model partitions of the same FMU).
* The Scheduled Execution interface allows the FMU to send an event to the scheduler while a model partition is executed.


_[A parallel computation of model partitions is not part of the FMI 3.0 API._
_An FMU may still internally use parallel computation on multiple cores, but handling this is (currently) not part of the FMI standard.]_
