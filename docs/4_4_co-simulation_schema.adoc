=== Description Schema [[co-simulation-schema]]

The common XML elements and attributes are defined in <<modelDescription.xml,FMI Description Schema>>.
Additional elements and attributes are defined subsequently.
If the FMU implements the Co-Simulation interface type, the element `<CoSimulation>` must be present.
It is defined as:

.CoSimulation element.

The attributes in the following table are defined on top of the <<common-capability-flags, common attributes>> and have the following meaning (all attributes are optional with exception of <<modelIdentifier>>):

|Attribute
|Description

|[[canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize,`canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`]] `canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`
|If `canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize = true`, then the communication step size (argument <<communicationStepSize>> of <<fmi3DoStep>>) can vary for each call.

|[[fixedInternalStepSize,`fixedInternalStepSize`]]`fixedInternalStepSize`
|The fixed internal step size of the FMU (optional).
+
_[This information can be used by the co-simulation algorithm to synchronize the communication interval with the internal step size of the FMU._
_The co-simulation algorithm should calculate the communication points by multiplying (`number_of_steps * step_size`) instead of repeatedly incrementing (`time += step_size`) to avoid the accumulation of numerical errors.]_

|[[maxOutputDerivativeOrder,`maxOutputDerivativeOrder`]] `maxOutputDerivativeOrder`
|The FMU is able to provide <<derivative,`derivatives`>> of <<output,`outputs`>> with maximum order.
Calling of `fmi3GetOutputDerivatives` is allowed up to the order defined by `maxOutputDerivativeOrder`.

|[[recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness,`recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness`]] `recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness`
|A value of latexmath:[k] with latexmath:[k>0] signals to the co-simulation algorithm, that it is beneficial for the solver to receive intermediate inputs that are k-time continuously differentiable (latexmath:[C^k]) on the current communication interval.
latexmath:[k = 0] means continuous (see <<smoothness>>). +

|[[providesIntermediateUpdate,`providesIntermediateUpdate`]] `providesIntermediateUpdate`
|The FMU supports <<IntermediateUpdateMode>> and will call <<fmi3IntermediateUpdateCallback>>, if provided.

|[[mightReturnEarlyFromDoStep,`mightReturnEarlyFromDoStep`]] `mightReturnEarlyFromDoStep`
|The FMU announces that it might <<earlyReturn,return early>> from <<fmi3DoStep>>.
If this flag is `false` (the default), the importer can assume that the FMU computes the <<fmi3DoStep>> as instructed up until <<currentCommunicationPoint>> + <<communicationStepSize>>.

|[[canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate,`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate`]] `canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate`
|If `true`, the FMU is able to return early from <<fmi3DoStep>> if the co-simulation algorithm returns <<earlyReturnRequested,`earlyReturnRequested = fmi3True`>> from the callback <<intermediateUpdate>> and <<canReturnEarly,`canReturnEarly = fmi3True`>>.
The default value of this capability flag is `false`.

|[[hasEventMode,`hasEventMode`]]`hasEventMode`
|If `true` the FMU supports <<EventMode>>.
Even if this flag is `true`, the co-simulation algorithm can chose to delegate event handling to the FMU by calling <<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> with <<eventModeUsed,`eventModeUsed = fmi3False`>>.
If `eventModeUsed = fmi3True`, the co-simulation algorithm will have to actively trigger event handling in the FMU using <<fmi3EnterEventModeCS>>.
<<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> must only be called with `eventModeUsed = fmi3True` if <<hasEventMode,`hasEventMode = true`>>.
If the FMU has clocks, then  <<modelDescription.xml>> must set <<hasEventMode,`hasEventMode = true`>> and the importer must call <<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> with <<eventModeUsed,`eventModeUsed = fmi3True`>>.

|====

Note that if `needsExecutionTool = true`, then it is required that the original tool is available to be executed during co-simulation.
If `needsExecutionTool = false`, the FMU is completely contained inside the FMU in source code or binary format (DLL/SharedObject).

==== Example XML Description File

===== Example XML Description File with Early Return [[xml-example-co-simulation]]

The <<xml-example-fmimodeldescription-cosimulation>> below is the same as shown in <<xml-example-model-exchange>> for a Model Exchange FMU.
The only differences are the replacement of the element `<ModelExchange>` with the element `<CoSimulation>` (with additional attributes),  and the removal of <<local>> variables, which are associated with continuous <<state,states>> and their <<derivative,`derivatives`>> and presence of the capability flags <<canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize>> and <<canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate>> with value `true`.
