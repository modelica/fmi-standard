=== Description Schema [[co-simulation-schema]]

XML elements and attributes common to all interface types are defined in <<modelDescription.xml,FMI Description Schema>>.
Additional elements and attributes are defined subsequently.
If the FMU implements the Co-Simulation interface type, the element `<CoSimulation>` must be present.
It is defined as:

.CoSimulation element.

The attributes in the following table are defined in addition to the <<common-capability-flags, common attributes>> and have the following meaning (all attributes are optional with the exception of <<modelIdentifier>>):

.CoSimulation attribute details.

|Attribute
|Description

|`canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`
|[[canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize,`canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`]]If `canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize = true`, then the communication step size (argument <<communicationStepSize>> of <<fmi3DoStep>>) can vary for each call.

|`fixedInternalStepSize`
|[[fixedInternalStepSize,`fixedInternalStepSize`]]If the FMU has a fixed internal step size, this optional attribute communicates it. +
_[This information can be used by the importer to synchronize the communication interval with that fixed internal step size of the FMU._
_The importer should use an integer multiple of this value as <<communicationStepSize,communication step size>>.]_

|`maxOutputDerivativeOrder`
|[[maxOutputDerivativeOrder,`maxOutputDerivativeOrder`]]The FMU is able to provide <<derivative,`derivatives`>> of <<output,`outputs`>> up to the order of `maxOutputDerivativeOrder`.
Calling of `fmi3GetOutputDerivatives` is allowed up to the order defined by `maxOutputDerivativeOrder`.

|`recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness`
|[[recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness,`recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness`]]A value of latexmath:[k] with latexmath:[k>0] signals to the importer, that it is beneficial for the solver within the FMU to receive intermediate inputs that are latexmath:[k]-time continuously differentiable (latexmath:[C^k]) on the current communication interval.
latexmath:[k = 0] means continuous (see <<smoothness>>).

|`providesIntermediateUpdate`
|[[providesIntermediateUpdate,`providesIntermediateUpdate`]]The FMU supports <<IntermediateUpdateMode>> and will call <<fmi3IntermediateUpdateCallback>>, if provided.

|`mightReturnEarlyFromDoStep`
|[[mightReturnEarlyFromDoStep,`mightReturnEarlyFromDoStep`]]The FMU announces that it might <<earlyReturn,return early>> from <<fmi3DoStep>>.
If this flag is `false`, the importer can assume that the FMU computes the <<fmi3DoStep>> as instructed up until <<currentCommunicationPoint>> + <<communicationStepSize>>.

|`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate`
|[[canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate,`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate`]]If `true`, the FMU is able to return early from <<fmi3DoStep>> if the importer returns <<earlyReturnRequested,`earlyReturnRequested = fmi3True`>> from the callback <<intermediateUpdate>>.
`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate` may only be `true`, if <<providesIntermediateUpdate>> is `true`.

|`hasEventMode`
|[[hasEventMode,`hasEventMode`]]If `true` the FMU supports <<EventMode>>. +
If the importer does not support <<EventMode>>, then it must call <<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> with <<eventModeUsed,`eventModeUsed = fmi3False`>> to force the FMU to detect and handle events internally. +
If `eventModeUsed = fmi3True`, the importer must actively trigger event handling at communication points in the FMU using <<fmi3EnterEventModeCS>>. +
If the FMU has clocks, then <<hasEventMode>> must be `true`.

==== Example Model Description File

===== Example Model Description File with Early Return [[xml-example-co-simulation]]

The <<xml-example-fmimodeldescription-cosimulation>> below is the same as shown in <<xml-example-model-exchange>> for a Model Exchange FMU.
The only differences are the replacement of the element `<ModelExchange>` with the element `<CoSimulation>` with additional Co-Simulation-specific attributes, and the removal of <<local>> variables, which are associated with continuous <<state,states>> and their <<derivative,`derivatives`>>.
