=== Description Schema [[co-simulation-schema]]

XML elements and attributes common to all interface types are defined in <<modelDescription.xml,FMI Description Schema>>.
Additional elements and attributes are defined subsequently.
If the FMU implements the Co-Simulation interface type, the element `<CoSimulation>` must be present.
It is defined as:

.CoSimulation element.

The attributes in the following table are defined in addition to the <<common-capability-flags, common attributes>> and have the following meaning (all attributes are optional with the exception of <<modelIdentifier>>):

.CoSimulation attribute details.

|Attribute
|Description

|`canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`
|[[canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize,`canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`]]If `canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize = true`, then the communication step size (argument <<communicationStepSize>> of <<fmi3DoStep>>) can vary for each call.

|`fixedInternalStepSize`
|[[fixedInternalStepSize,`fixedInternalStepSize`]]If the FMU has a fixed internal step size, this optional attribute communicates it.

NOTE: This information can be used by the importer to synchronize the communication interval with that fixed internal step size of the FMU.
The importer should use an integer multiple of this value as <<communicationStepSize,communication step size>>.

|`maxOutputDerivativeOrder`
|[[maxOutputDerivativeOrder,`maxOutputDerivativeOrder`]]The FMU is able to provide <<derivative,`derivatives`>> of <<output,`outputs`>> up to the order of `maxOutputDerivativeOrder`.
Calling of `fmi3GetOutputDerivatives` is allowed up to the order defined by `maxOutputDerivativeOrder`.

|`recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness`
|[[recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness,`recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness`]]A value of latexmath:[k] with latexmath:[k>0] signals to the importer, that it is beneficial for the solver within the FMU to receive intermediate inputs that are latexmath:[k]-time continuously differentiable (latexmath:[C^k]) on the current communication interval.
latexmath:[k = 0] means continuous (see <<smoothness>>).

|`providesIntermediateUpdate`
|[[providesIntermediateUpdate,`providesIntermediateUpdate`]]The FMU supports <<IntermediateUpdateMode>> and will call <<fmi3IntermediateUpdateCallback>>, if provided.

|`mightReturnEarlyFromDoStep`
|[[mightReturnEarlyFromDoStep,`mightReturnEarlyFromDoStep`]]The FMU announces that it might <<earlyReturn,return early>> from <<fmi3DoStep>>.
If this flag is `false`, the importer can assume that the FMU computes the <<fmi3DoStep>> as instructed up until <<currentCommunicationPoint>> + <<communicationStepSize>>.

|`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate`
|[[canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate,`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate`]]If `true`, the FMU is able to return early from <<fmi3DoStep>> if the importer returns <<earlyReturnRequested,`earlyReturnRequested = fmi3True`>> from the callback <<intermediateUpdate>>.
`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate` may only be `true`, if <<providesIntermediateUpdate>> is `true`.

|`hasEventMode`
|[[hasEventMode,`hasEventMode`]]If `true` the FMU supports <<EventMode>>. +
If the importer does not support <<EventMode>>, then it must call <<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> with <<eventModeUsed,`eventModeUsed = fmi3False`>> to force the FMU to detect and handle events internally. +
If `eventModeUsed = fmi3True`, the importer must actively trigger event handling at communication points in the FMU using <<fmi3EnterEventModeCS>>. +
If the FMU has clocks, then <<hasEventMode>> must be `true`.

==== Example Model Description File

===== Example Model Description File with Early Return [[xml-example-co-simulation]]

The <<xml-example-fmimodeldescription-cosimulation>> below is the same as shown in <<xml-example-model-exchange>> for a Model Exchange FMU.
The only differences are the replacement of the element `<ModelExchange>` with the element `<CoSimulation>` with additional Co-Simulation-specific attributes, and the removal of <<local>> variables, which are associated with continuous <<state,states>> and their <<derivative,`derivatives`>>.
