=== Description Schema [[co-simulation-schema]]

The common XML elements and attributes are defined in <<fmi-description-schema>>.
Additional elements and attributes are defined subsequently.
If the FMU implements the Co-Simulation interface type, the element `<CoSimulation>` must be present.
It is defined as:

.CoSimulation element.

The attributes in the following table are defined on top of the <<common-capability-flags, common attributes>> and have the following meaning (all attributes are optional with exception of <<modelIdentifier>>):

.CoSimulation attribute details.

|Attribute
|Description

|<<modelIdentifier>>
|Short class name according to C syntax, for example, `A_B_C`.
Used as prefix for FMI functions if the functions are provided in C source code or in static libraries, but not if the functions are provided by a DLL/SharedObject.
<<modelIdentifier>> is also used as name of the static library or DLL/SharedObject.
See also <<header-files-and-naming-of-functions>>.

|[[canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize,`canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`]] `canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`
|If `canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize = true`, then the communication step size (argument <<communicationStepSize>> of <<fmi3DoStep>>) can vary for each call.

|[[canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate,`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate`]] `canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate`
|If `true`, the FMU is able to return early from <<fmi3DoStep>> if the co-simulation algorithm returns <<earlyReturnRequested,`earlyReturnRequested == fmi3True`>> from the callback <<intermediateUpdate>> and <<canReturnEarly,`canReturnEarly == fmi3True`>>.
The default value of this capability flag is `false`.

|[[fixedInternalStepSize,`fixedInternalStepSize`]]`fixedInternalStepSize`
|The fixed internal step size of the FMU (optional).
+
_[This information can be used by the co-simulation algorithm to synchronize the communication interval with the internal step size of the FMU._
_The co-simulation algorithm should calculate the communication points by multiplying (`number_of_steps * step_size`) instead of repeatedly incrementing (`time += step_size`) to avoid the accumulation of numerical errors.]_

|[[hasEventMode,`hasEventMode`]]`hasEventMode`
|If `true` the FMU supports <<EventMode>>.
Even if this flag is `true`, the co-simulation algorithm can chose to delegate event handling to the FMU by calling <<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> with <<eventModeUsed,`eventModeUsed == fmi3False`>>.
If `eventModeUsed == fmi3True`, the co-simulation algorithm will have to actively trigger event handling in the FMU using <<fmi3EnterEventMode>>.
<<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> must only be called with `eventModeUsed == fmi3True` if <<hasEventMode,`hasEventMode == true`>>.
If the FMU has synchronous clocks, then `eventModeUsed == fmi3True` and the importer must call <<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> with <<eventModeUsed,`eventModeUsed == fmi3True`>>.
|====

Note that if `needsExecutionTool = true`, then it is required that the original tool is available to be executed during co-simulation.
If `needsExecutionTool = false`, the FMU is completely contained inside the FMU in source code or binary format (DLL/SharedObject).

==== Example XML Description File

===== Example XML Description File with Early Return [[xml-example-co-simulation]]

The <<xml-example-fmimodeldescription-cosimulation>> below is the same as shown in <<xml-example-model-exchange>> for a Model Exchange FMU.
The only differences are the replacement of the element `<ModelExchange>` with the element `<CoSimulation>` (with additional attributes),  and the removal of <<local>> variables, which are associated with continuous <<state,`states`>> and their <<derivative,`derivatives`>> and presence of the capability flags <<canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize>> and <<canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate>> with value `true`.

===== Example XML Description File with Clocks [[xml-example-clocked-co-simulation]]

// TODO: Add example and rewrite paragraph

The example below is the same one as shown in <<xml-example-co-simulation>> for a Co-Simulation FMU.
The only differences are, that the element `<fmiModelDescription><CoSimulation>` is present and <<Clock,`Clocks`>> are defined in the <<modelDescription.xml>>.
The XML file may have the following content:
