=== Mathematical Description [[math-co-simulation]]


This section contains a formal mathematical model of Co-Simulation FMUs.

_[The following fundamental assumptions are made:_
_The FMUs are seen by the co-simulation algorithm as purely sampled-data systems, with the exception, that the simulation algorithm can provide input data of a defined level of smoothness (with the flag <<recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness>>) within a communication interval via the intermediate update mechanism (see <<IntermediateUpdateMode>>)._

_Such a sampled-data system consists typically of a hybrid ODE that is integrated between communication points (known as "sampled access to time continuous systems") where internal events may occur and be handled, but events are not visible from the outside of the FMU._

_Co-Simulation FMUs can also be used for real sampled-data systems (so a sampled discrete controller; the <<input,`inputs`>> and <<output,`outputs`>> could be of type `<Float{32|64}>`, `<[U]Int{8|16|32|64}>`, `<Boolean>`, `<String>`, `<Clock>` or `<Enumeration>` with <<variability>> = <<discrete>>.)_
_However, in FMI 3.0, Co-Simulation (CS) and Scheduled Execution (SE) may likely be more suitable for this use-case._ +
_And - at least without using intermediate update (see <<IntermediateUpdateMode>>), which is untypical for sampled data systems - with Co-Simulation there will always be a communication step delay for information going "through the FMU", so there cannot be an immediate reaction as in Co-Simulation (see <<fmi-for-co-simulation>>)._
_]_

The communication between the importer and a FMU takes place at

- a discrete set of time instants, called communication points, where input variables may change in non-smooth or even non-continuous way.

- intermediate time instances, where the simulation algorithm may get and set variables using <<IntermediateUpdateMode>>.

When the transient simulation of the coupled system through Co-Simulation is completed, the sequence of evaluations is the following (here latexmath:[\mathbf{x} = {\lbrack \mathbf{x}_c; \mathbf{x}_d \rbrack}^T] is the combined vector of continuous-time and discrete-time states, and latexmath:[\mathbf{y} = {\lbrack \mathbf{y}_c; \mathbf{y}_d \rbrack}^T]) is the combined vector of continuous-time and discrete-time <<output,`outputs`>>):

Definition <<equation-co-simulation-evaluations>> is consistent with the definition of co-simulation by <<KS00>>.

* At the communication points, the simulation algorithm provides generalized inputs to the FMU:

** The current <<input>> variables latexmath:[\mathbf{u}_i] of the FMU (in other words, the <<input>> variables of the model represented by the FMU, in the sense of system-level simulation).

** Varying <<parameter,`parameters`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{p}_{\mathit{tune},i}], also known as <<tunable>> <<parameter,`parameters`>>.

* The FMU provides generalized outputs to the simulation algorithm, which are:

** The current output variables latexmath:[\mathbf{y}_{i+1}^{(0)}] of the FMU (same remark as above), along with some of their successive <<derivative,`derivatives`>> latexmath:[\left\{ \mathbf{y}_{i+1}^{(j)} \right\}_{j=1,\cdots,m_{odo}}] (in case of continuous-time variables).

** Observation variables and <<calculated>> varying <<parameter,`parameters`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{w}_{i+1}], along with directional derivatives estimated at latexmath:[t = t_{i+1}] (in case of continuous-time variables).

* At intermediate times latexmath:[t\in (t_i, t_{i+1})] the simulation algorithm and the FMU exchange values for latexmath:[\mathbf{u}_u(t)] and latexmath:[\mathbf{y}_u(t)].

* Initialization: The FMU being a sampled-data system, its internal states (which can be either continuous-time or discrete-time) need to be initialized at latexmath:[t = t_0].
This is performed through an auxiliary function _[this relationship is defined in the XML file under elements `<ModelStructure><InitialUnknown>`]_:

Computing the solution of an FMI Co-Simulation model means to split the solution process in two phases and in every phase different equations and solution methods are utilized.
The phases can be categorized according to the following modes:

==== Initialization Mode
This mode is used to compute at the start time latexmath:[t_0] initial values for all variables of the Co-Simulation FMU, especially for continuous-time <<state,`states`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_c(t_0)], discrete-time states latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t_0)], and for the previous discrete-time states latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t_0)] by utilizing extra equations only present in *Initialization Mode* _[for example, equations to set all <<derivative,`derivatives`>> to zero, that is, to initialize in steady-state]_.

If the FMU is connected in loops with other models, iterations over the FMU equations are possible.
Algebraic equations are solved in this mode.

==== Step Mode
This mode is used to compute the values of all continuous-time and discrete-time variables at communication points by numerically solving ordinary differential, algebraic and discrete equations.
If the FMU is connected in loops with other models, no iterations over the FMU equations are possible for a given communication point.

_[Note that for a Co-Simulation FMU, no super-dense time description is used at communication points.]_

The equations are defined in <<table-math-co-simulation>> can be evaluated in the respective mode.
The following color coding is used in the table:

==== Smoothness, Continuity and Discontinuity [[smoothness]]

Since inputs will be set at specific communication points by the importing tool, the FMU must make assumptions about the values between these communication points, including points of intermediate updates.

Between communication points, even when intermediate updates are called, all changes must be assumed to be continuous.
Changes to <<continuous>> variables are only considered discrete in *Event Mode*.

<<continuous, Continuous>> inputs may change between communication points in case of <<intermediateVariableSetRequested, `intermediateVariableSetRequested == true`>>.
These intermediate values are provided by the co-simulation algorithm for example by an extrapolation polynomial build with the output derivatives of connected FMUs (see <<recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness>>).
FMUs can signal with the optional flag <<recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness>> of value latexmath:[k] to the co-simulation algorithm that best convergence rates can be achieved if the functions are of smoothness latexmath:[C^{k}([t_i, t_{i+1}\])], that is k-time continuously differentiable, with latexmath:[C^{0}] meaning continuous.
It is therefore recommended that the function defined by the continuation of latexmath:[\mathbf{u}_{i, u}] with latexmath:[\mathbf{u}_{i+1, u}] is of smoothness latexmath:[C^{k}([t_i, t_{i+2}\])] with the optional flag <<recommendedIntermediateInputSmoothness>> of value latexmath:[k]. +
_[This can increase simulation speed for higher order multi-step solvers that in this case do not have to reset at communication points.]_

For <<continuous>> input variables, the importer must ensure that the input approximation function latexmath:[\mathbf{u}_u] is consistent with the values of the input variable (latexmath:[\mathbf{u}_u(t_{i+1})= \mathbf{u}(t_{i+1})]). +
If a <<continuous>> input changes `discontinuously` (e.g. the actual input value deviates too much from the extrapolation polynomial), the co-simulation algorithm must raise an event (if supported) to indicate to the FMU a discontinuous change at an input.

_[In the case of Co-Simulation without events, detecting discrete changes to continuous input variables (for instance to reset the integration algorithm) requires heuristics.]_

<<discrete, `Discrete`>> inputs keep their values between communication points.
Furthermore, changing <<discrete>> variables at communication points will likely require special handling within the FMU.
Since the FMU itself can detect such changes, the co-simulation algorithm does not need to raise explicit events in such a case.
