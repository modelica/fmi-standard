==== Co-Simulation [[math-co-simulation]]

===== Basics Co-Simulation

Co-simulation exploits the modular structure of coupled problems in all stages of the simulation process beginning with the separate model setup and preprocessing for the individual subsystems in different simulation tools (which can be powerful simulators as well as simple C programs).
During time integration, the simulation is again performed independently for all subsystems restricting the data exchange between subsystems to discrete communication points latexmath:[tc_i].
For simulator coupling, also the visualization and post-processing of simulation data is done individually for each subsystem in its own native simulation tool.
In different contexts, the communication points latexmath:[tc_i], the communication steps latexmath:[tc_i \rightarrow tc_{i+1}] and the communication step sizes latexmath:[hc_i := tc_{i+1} - tc_i] are also known as sampling points (synchronization points), macro steps and sampling rates, respectively.
The term "communication point" in FMI for Co-Simulation refers to the communication between subsystems in a co-simulation environment and should not be mixed with the output points for saving simulation results to file.

FMI for Co-Simulation provides an interface standard for the solution of time-dependent coupled systems consisting of subsystems that are continuous in time (model components that are described by instationary differential equations) or time-discrete (model components that are described by difference equations such as discrete controllers).
In a block representation of the coupled system, the subsystems are represented by blocks with (internal) <<state>> variables latexmath:[x(t)] that are connected to other subsystems (blocks) of the coupled problem by _subsystem <<input,`inputs`>>_ latexmath:[u(t)] and _subsystem <<output,`outputs`>>_ latexmath:[y(t)].
In this framework, the physical connections between subsystems are represented by mathematical coupling conditions between the inputs latexmath:[u(t)] and the <<output,`outputs`>> latexmath:[y(t)] of all subsystems, <<KS00>>.

.Data flow at communication points.
image::images/co-simulation-data-flow.svg[width=80%, align="center"]

For Co-Simulation two basic groups of functions have to be implemented:

. functions for the data exchange between subsystems

. functions for algorithmic issues to synchronize the simulation of all subsystems and to proceed in communication steps latexmath:[tc_i \rightarrow tc_{i+1}] from initial time latexmath:[tc_0 := t_{start}] to end time latexmath:[tc_N := t_{stop}]

In FMI for Co-Simulation, both functions are implemented in one software component, the Co-Simulation master.
The data exchange between the subsystems (slaves) is handled via the master only.
There is no direct communication between the slaves.
The master functionality can be implemented by a special software tool (a separate simulation backplane) or by one of the involved simulation tools.
In its most general form, the coupled system may be simulated in nested co-simulation environments and FMI for Co-Simulation applies to each level of the hierarchy.

FMI for Co-Simulation defines interface routines for the communication between the master and all slaves (subsystems) in a co-simulation environment.
The most common master algorithm stops at each communication point latexmath:[tc_i] the simulation (time integration) of all slaves, collects the outputs latexmath:[y(tc_i)] from all subsystems, evaluates the subsystem inputs latexmath:[u(tc_i)], distributes these subsystem inputs to the slaves and continues the (co-)simulation with the next communication step latexmath:[tc_i \rightarrow tc_{i+1} = tc_i + hc] with fixed communication step size latexmath:[hc].
In each slave, an appropriate solver is used to integrate one of the subsystems for a given communication step latexmath:[tc_i \rightarrow tc_{i+1}].
The most simple Co-Simulation algorithms approximate the (unknown) subsystem inputs latexmath:[u(t), (t > tc_i))] by frozen data latexmath:[u(tc_i)] for latexmath:[tc_i \leq t < tc_{i+1}].
FMI for Co-Simulation supports this classical brute force approach as well as more sophisticated master algorithms.
FMI for Co-Simulation is designed to support a very general class of master algorithms but it does not define the master algorithm itself.

The ability of slaves to support more sophisticated master algorithms is characterized by a set of capability flags inside the XML description of the slave (see <<fmi-for-co-simulation>>).
Typical examples are:

- the ability to handle variable communication step sizes latexmath:[hc_i],

- the ability to repeat a rejected communication step latexmath:[tc_i \rightarrow tc_{i+1}] with reduced communication step size,

- the ability to provide <<derivative,`derivatives`>> w.r.t. time of <<output,`outputs`>> to allow interpolation (<<transfer-of-input-output-and-parameters>>),

- or the ability to provide Jacobians.

FMI for Co-Simulation is restricted to slaves with the following properties:

. All calculated values are time-dependent functions within an a priori defined time interval latexmath:[t_{start} \leq t \leq t_{stop}] (provided `stopTimeDefined = fmi3True` when calling <<fmi3SetupExperiment>>).

. All calculations (simulations) are carried out with increasing time in general.
The current time latexmath:[t] is running step by step from latexmath:[t_{start}] to latexmath:[t_{stop}].
The algorithm of the slave may have the property to be able to repeat the simulation of parts of latexmath:[[t_{start}, t_{stop}]] or the whole time interval latexmath:[[t_{start}, t_{stop}]].

. The slave can be given a time value latexmath:[tc_i, t_{start} \leq tc_i \leq t_{stop}].

. The slave is able to interrupt the simulation when latexmath:[tc_i] is reached.

. During the interrupted simulation the slave (and its individual solver) can receive values for <<input,`inputs`>> latexmath:[u(tc_i)] and send values of outputs latexmath:[y(tc_i)].

. Whenever the simulation in a slave is interrupted, a new time value latexmath:[tc_{i+1}, tc_i \leq tc_{i+1} \leq t_{stop}], can be given to simulate the time subinterval latexmath:[tc_i < t \leq tc_{i+1}]

. The subinterval length latexmath:[hc_i] is the communication step size of the latexmath:[i^{th}] communication step, latexmath:[hc_i = tc_{i+1} - tc_i].

The communication step size has to be greater than zero.

FMI for Co-Simulation allows a Co-Simulation flow which starts with instantiation and initialization (all slaves are prepared for computation, the communication links are established), followed by simulation (the slaves are forced to simulate a communication step), and finishes with shutdown.
The details of the flow are given in the state machine of the calling sequences from master to slave (see <<state-machine-co-simulation>>).

// TODO: Move to better place of function abbreviation definition in document

This section contains a formal mathematical model of a Co-Simulation FMU.
The following fundamental assumptions are made:

The slave simulators are seen by the master simulator as purely sampled-data systems.
Such a sampled-data system can be:

- A real sampled-data system (so a sampled discrete controller; the <<input,`inputs`>> and <<output,`outputs`>> can be of type Real, Integer, Boolean, String, or enumeration.
Variables of this type are defined with <<variability>> = <<discrete>>; the smallest sample period as accessible by the outside of the FMU is defined by attribute `stepSize` in element `DefaultExperiment`).

- A hybrid ODE that is integrated between communication points (known as "sampled access to time continuous systems") where internal events may occur and be handled, but events are not visible from the outside of the FMU.
It is assumed here that all <<input,`inputs`>> and all <<output,`outputs`>> of this hybrid ODE are Real signals (defined with <<variability>> = <<continuous>>),

- A combination of the systems above.

The communication between the master and a slave takes only place at a discrete set of time instants, called communication points.

An FMI Co-Simulation model is described by the following variables:

[options="header", cols="^1,7"]
|====
|Variable
|Description

|latexmath:[t]
|Independent variable time latexmath:[\in \mathbb{R}].
(Variable defined with <<causality>> = <<independent>>). +
The i-th communication point is denoted as latexmath:[t = tc_i] +
The communication step size is denoted as latexmath:[hc_i = tc_{i+1} - tc_i]

|latexmath:[\mathbf{v}]
| A vector of all exposed variables (all variables defined in element `<ModelVariables>`, see <<definition-of-model-variables>>).
A subset of the variables is selected via a subscript.
Example: +
latexmath:[\mathbf{v}_{initial=exact}] are variables defined with attribute <<initial>> = <<exact>>, see <<definition-of-model-variables>>.
These are <<independent>> <<parameter,`parameters`>> and <<start>> values of other variables, such as initial values for <<state,`states`>>, state derivatives or <<output,outputs>>.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{p}]
|Parameters that are constant during simulation.
The symbol without a subscript references <<independent>> <<parameter,`parameters`>> (variables with <<causality>> = <<parameter>>).
Dependent <<parameter,`parameters`>> (variables with <<causality>> = <<calculatedParameter>>) are denoted as latexmath:[\mathbf{p}_{calculated}] and <<tunable>> <<parameter,`parameters`>> (variables with <<causality>> = <<parameter>> and <<variability>> = <<tunable>>) are denoted as latexmath:[\mathbf{p}_{tune}].

|latexmath:[\mathbf{u}(tc_i)]
|Input variables.
The values of these variables are defined outside of the model.
Variables of this type are defined with attribute <<causality>> = <<input>>.
Whether the <<input>> is a discrete-time or continuous-time variable is defined via attribute <<variability>> = <<discrete>> or <<continuous>> (see <<definition-of-model-variables>>).

|latexmath:[\mathbf{y}(tc_i)]
|Output variables.
The values of these variables are computed in the FMU and they are designed to be used in a model connection.
So output variables might be used in the environment as input values to other FMUs or other submodels.
Variables of this type are defined with attribute <<causality>> = <<output>>.
Via attribute <<variability>> = <<discrete>> or <<continuous>> it is defined whether the <<output>> is a discrete-time or continuous-time variable, see <<definition-of-model-variables>>.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{w}(tc_i)]
|Local variables of the FMU that cannot be used for FMU connections.
Variables of this type are defined with attribute <<causality>> = <<local>> (see <<definition-of-model-variables>>).

|latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_c(t)]
|A vector of real continuous-time variables representing the continuous-time <<state,`states`>>.
For notational convenience, a continuous-time <<state>> is conceptually treated as a different type of variable as an <<output>> or a <<local>> variable for the mathematical description below.
However, at a communication point, a continuous-time <<state>> is part of the <<output,`outputs`>> or the <<local>> variables latexmath:[\mathbf{w}] of an FMU.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t)] +
latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t)]
|latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t)] is a vector of (internal) discrete-time variables (of any type) representing the (internal) discrete <<state,`states`>>. +
latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t)] is the value of latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t)] at the previous sample time instant, so latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t) = \mathbf{x}_d(^{\bullet}t)]. +
Given the <<previous>> values of the discrete-time <<state,`states`>>, latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t)], at the actual time instant latexmath:[t], all other discrete-time variables, especially the discrete <<state,`states`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t)], can be computed. +
Discrete <<state,`states`>> are not visible in the interface of an FMU and are only introduced here to clarify the mathematical description.
Formally, a discrete <<state>> is part of the <<output,`outputs`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{y}] or the <<local>> variables latexmath:[\mathbf{w}] of an FMU.

When the transient simulation of the coupled system through Co-Simulation is completed, the sequence of evaluations is the following (here latexmath:[\mathbf{x} = {\lbrack \mathbf{x}_c; \mathbf{x}_d \rbrack}^T] is the combined vector of continuous-time and discrete-time <<state,states>>, and latexmath:[\mathbf{y} = {\lbrack \mathbf{y}_c; \mathbf{y}_d \rbrack}^T]) is the combined vector of continuous-time and discrete-time <<output,`outputs`>>):

Definition <<equation-co-simulation-evaluations>> is consistent with the definition of co-simulation by <<KS00>>.

* At the communication points, the master provides generalized inputs to the slave, which can be:

** The current <<input>> variables latexmath:[\mathbf{u}_i^{(0)}] of the subsystem (in other words, the <<input>> variables of the model contained in the slave simulator, in the sense of system-level simulation), along with some of their successive <<derivative,`derivatives`>> latexmath:[\left\{ \mathbf{u}_i^{(j)} \right\}_{j=1,\cdots,m_{ido}}] (in case of continuous-time variables).

** Varying <<parameter,`parameters`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{p}_{tune,i}], also known as <<tunable>> <<parameter,`parameters`>>.

* The slave provides generalized outputs to the master, which are:

** The current output variables latexmath:[\mathbf{y}_{i+1}^{(0)}]of the subsystem (same remark as above), along with some of their successive <<derivative,`derivatives`>> latexmath:[\left\{ \mathbf{y}_{i+1}^{(j)} \right\}_{j=1,\cdots,m_{odo}}](in case of continuous-time variables).

** Observation variables and <<calculated>> varying <<parameter,`parameters`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{w}_{i+1}], along with directional derivatives estimated at latexmath:[t = tc_{i+1}] (in case of continuous-time variables).

* Initialization: The slave being a sampled-data system, its internal states (which can be either continuous-time or discrete-time) need to be initialized at latexmath:[t = tc_0].
This is performed through an auxiliary function _[this relationship is defined in the XML file under `<ModelStructure><InitialUnknowns>`]_:

Computing the solution of an FMI Co-Simulation model means to split the solution process in two phases and in every phase different equations and solution methods are utilized.
The phases can be categorized according to the following modes:

Initialization Mode::
This mode is used to compute at the start time latexmath:[t_0] initial values for internal variables of the Co-Simulation slave, especially for continuous-time <<state,`states`>>, latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t_0)], and for the previous discrete-time <<state,`states`>>, latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t_0)], by utilizing extra equations not present in the other mode _[for example, equations to set all <<derivative,`derivatives`>> to zero, that is, to initialize in steady-state]_.
If the slave is connected in loops with other models, iterations over the FMU equations are possible.
Algebraic equations are solved in this mode.

Step Mode::
This mode is used to compute the values of all (real) continuous-time and discrete-time variables at communication points by numerically solving ordinary differential, algebraic and discrete equations.
If the slave is connected in loops with other models, no iterations over the FMU equations are possible.

_[Note that for a Co-Simulation FMU, no super dense time description is used at communication points.]_

The equations are defined in <<table-math-co-simulation>> can be evaluated in the respective Mode.
The following color coding is used in the table:

==== Early Return from Current Communication Step
:DOSTEP: fmi3DoStep()
:CBIU: fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate()
:DER:  fmi3DoEarlyReturn()

//=== Improving efficiency in multi-FMU environment when asynchronous mode is used

In the particular context of multi-FMU architectures, significant co-simulation speed-up may be obtained if the master can avoid waiting until the end of the slowest FMU step integration.
If an FMU prematurely stops its current step integration computation due to an unpredictable internal event before the normal end of the step calculation, all other concurrently running FMUs may be stopped as soon as possible in order to minimize the time needed for the Co-Simulation master to resynchronize all the FMUs at the same event time.

In this context based on parallel multi-FMU calculations, the following figure illustrates different possibilities to synchronize FMUs at the same event time.

.Different possibilities to synchronize parallel FMUs at the same event time.

[caption="Figure 12: "]
image::images/earlyReturnFigure.png[width=100%, align="center"]

Each FMU starts integration from communication point latexmath:[t_{i}] to reach the next communication point latexmath:[t_{i+1}].
Assuming an unexpected internal event is detected at latexmath:[t^{'}_{i+1}< t_{i+1}] during FMU~1~ integration, the master is informed of this early return.
So now the master would like to avoid other FMUs exceed the event time, since all FMUs should be resynchronized at the event time which will be the next new communication point.

* In the case of FMU~1~, the internal event time becomes the new latexmath:[t_{i+1}] time, i.e. this is the source of the event.
* In the case of FMU~2~, a complete rollback from latexmath:[t_{i}] to latexmath:[t^{'}_{i+1}] is necessary.
* In the case of FMU~3~, computation is immediately interrupted and only a partial rollback is necessary to reach latexmath:[t^{'}_{i+1}] time.
* In the case of FMU~4~, the current step integration has been interrupted at latexmath:[t^{'}_{i+1}] and no rollback is necessary.

Each ongoing FMU stops its integration either exactly at the broken time given by the master or immediately after its current intermediate step if this time is already out-of-date.
Afterwards, a new step integration done on the FMU returns and signals the premature stop (early-return) to the master.

Due to the early-return mechanism, the overall execution time of the simulation is reduced.

==== Co-Simulation with Clock Support [[math-clocked-co-simulation]]

The notion of <<clock>> in FMI for Model Exchange has been extended to the FMI for Co-Simulation.

Both <<outputClock,`output clocks`>> and <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> are supported in Co-Simulation with <<clock,`clocks`>>.
In order to handle <<inputClock,`input`>> and <<outputClock,`output clocks`>> in Co-Simulation, a new Event mode has been introduced.

The concept and the way <<inputClock,`input`>> and <<outputClock,`output clocks`>> are handled are very similar in Model Exchange and Co-simulation.
In order to handle <<inputClock,`input clocks`>>, the Co-Simulation master schedules <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> and adjusts the communication steps in such a way that <<inputClock>> ticks become communication points.
At these communication points, the FMU is pushed to the Event mode and <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> are handled.

<<outputClock,`Output clocks`>>, on the other hand, are detected by the FMU.
The FMU detects an <<outputClock>> and informs the master by invoking a callback in which the event time and the event type is communicated to the master.
Then FMU stops the current Co-Simulation step and returns back from <<fmi3DoStep>>.
Then the FMU is pushed to the Event mode and the event is handled.
Note that, since output events time instants are not known in advance, at output event time instants, new communication steps are created.


==== Scheduled Execution Simulation Support [[math-scheduled-execution-simulation]]

The Scheduled Execution Simulation mode has a different timing concept compared to the other Co-Simulation modes.
This is required to cover <<clock>> ticks for aperiodic <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> which may tick at time instances that are not predictable in advance for the simulation master.
Typically, hardware I/O or virtual ECU software events belong to this category.

A Co-Simulation master's call for computing a model partition will compute the results of the model partition defined by an <<inputClock>> for the current <<clock>> tick time latexmath:[t_i].

The result values will be computed for the current <<clock>> tick time (activation time) latexmath:[t_i] from the assigned <<inputClock>> (which is known to the Co-Simulation master).
Refer to the <<clock>> time progress definition (<<clock-types-for-evaluation-of-clocked-model-partitions>>) for periodic <<clock,`clocks`>>.

If required, the FMU can internally derive the <<clock>> interval latexmath:[\Delta T_i] based on the last <<clock>> tick time latexmath:[t_{i-1}] i.e. last activation time for this model partition.

A model partition can only be activated once per activation time point latexmath:[t_i].

Model partitions that are associated to <<outputClock,`output clocks`>> will accordingly provide the result values of the model partition's variables for the current <<outputClock>> tick time latexmath:[t_i] of the active <<outputClock>>.
The activation of such a <<outputClock>> is not directly controlled by the Co-Simulation master but internally by the FMU.

==== Intermediate Variable Access Support [[math-intermediate-variable-access]]

Intermediate variable access has three main uses:

. *An FMU is able to produce valid output variables at intermediate points during a communication interval.*
This is typically the result of an internal solver taking multiple integration steps at each communication interval.
The FMU exposes intermediate output variables for the master whenever they are available.
These can be used for e.g. extrapolation, interpolation, filtering or asynchronous co-simulation.

. *Intermediate <<input>> variables for an FMU is available in the Co-Simulation master.*
The FMU requests updated intermediate <<input>> variables every time they are required by the internal solver.
This can be either at temporary solver states or after successful integration steps.

. *Intermediate <<input>> variables for the FMU can be computed by the Co-Simulation master.*
The computation requires intermediate output variables from the FMU.
Whenever the internal solver in the FMU needs updated intermediate <<input>> variables, it provides the intermediate output variables for and requests the intermediate <<input>> variables from the master.

Combinations of the above methods are also allowed.

Access to intermediate variables enables several features such as:

* Advanced interpolation/extrapolation techniques
* Asynchronous communication
* Anti-alias filtering
* Smoothing of inputs
