=== Mathematical Description [[math-basic-co-simulation]]

// TODO: Move stuff here from the common concepts section.

This section contains a formal mathematical model of Co-Simulation FMUs.
// TODO: Is this true also for SCS?

_[The following fundamental assumptions are made:

_The slave simulators are seen by the master simulator as purely sampled-data systems._

_Such a sampled-data system consists typically of a hybrid ODE that is integrated between communication points (known as "sampled access to time continuous systems") where internal events may occur and be handled, but events are not visible from the outside of the FMU._
_It is assumed here that all <<input,`inputs`>> and all <<output,`outputs`>> of this hybrid ODE are floating point signals (defined with <<variability>> = <<continuous>>),_

_Co-Simulation FMUs can also be used for real sampled-data systems (so a sampled discrete controller; the <<input,`inputs`>> and <<output,`outputs`>> could be of type `<Float{32|64}>`, `<[U]Int{8|16|32|64}>`, `<Boolean>`, `<String>`, `<Clock>` or `<Enumeration>` with <<variability>> = <<discrete>>.)_
_However, in FMI 3.0, Hybrid Co-Simulation (HCS) and Scheduled Co-Simulation (SCS) may likely be more suitable for this use-case.]_

The communication between the master and a slave takes only place at a discrete set of time instants, called communication points.

An FMI Co-Simulation model is described by the following variables:

[options="header", cols="^1,7"]
|====
|Variable
|Description

|latexmath:[t]
|Independent variable time latexmath:[\in \mathbb{R}].
(Variable defined with <<causality>> = <<independent>>). +
The i-th communication point is denoted as latexmath:[t = tc_i] +
The communication step size is denoted as latexmath:[hc_i = tc_{i+1} - tc_i]

|latexmath:[\mathbf{v}]
| A vector of all exposed variables (all variables defined in element `<ModelVariables>`, see <<definition-of-model-variables>>).
A subset of the variables is selected via a subscript.
Example: +
latexmath:[\mathbf{v}_{initial=exact}] are variables defined with attribute <<initial>> = <<exact>>, see <<definition-of-model-variables>>.
These are <<independent>> <<parameter,`parameters`>> and <<start>> values of other variables, such as initial values for <<state,`states`>>, state derivatives or <<output,outputs>>.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{p}]
|Parameters that are constant during simulation.
The symbol without a subscript references <<independent>> <<parameter,`parameters`>> (variables with <<causality>> = <<parameter>>).
Dependent <<parameter,`parameters`>> (variables with <<causality>> = <<calculatedParameter>>) are denoted as latexmath:[\mathbf{p}_{calculated}] and <<tunable>> <<parameter,`parameters`>> (variables with <<causality>> = <<parameter>> and <<variability>> = <<tunable>>) are denoted as latexmath:[\mathbf{p}_{tune}].

|latexmath:[\mathbf{u}(tc_i)]
|Input variables.
The values of these variables are defined outside of the model.
Variables of this type are defined with attribute <<causality>> = <<input>>.
Whether the <<input>> is a discrete-time or continuous-time variable is defined via attribute <<variability>> = <<discrete>> or <<continuous>> (see <<definition-of-model-variables>>).

|latexmath:[\mathbf{y}(tc_i)]
|Output variables.
The values of these variables are computed in the FMU and they are designed to be used in a model connection.
So output variables might be used in the environment as input values to other FMUs or other submodels.
Variables of this type are defined with attribute <<causality>> = <<output>>.
Via attribute <<variability>> = <<discrete>> or <<continuous>> it is defined whether the <<output>> is a discrete-time or continuous-time variable, see <<definition-of-model-variables>>.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{w}(tc_i)]
|Local variables of the FMU that cannot be used for FMU connections.
Variables of this type are defined with attribute <<causality>> = <<local>> (see <<definition-of-model-variables>>).

|latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_c(t)]
|A vector of floating point continuous-time variables representing the continuous-time <<state,`states`>>.
For notational convenience, a continuous-time <<state>> is conceptually treated as a different type of variable as an <<output>> or a <<local>> variable for the mathematical description below.
However, at a communication point, a continuous-time <<state>> is part of the <<output,`outputs`>> or the <<local>> variables latexmath:[\mathbf{w}] of an FMU.

|latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t)] +
latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t)]
|latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t)] is a vector of (internal) discrete-time variables (of any type) representing the (internal) discrete <<state,`states`>>. +
latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t)] is the value of latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t)] at the previous sample time instant, so latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t) = \mathbf{x}_d(^{\bullet}t)]. +
Given the previous values of the discrete-time <<state,`states`>>, latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t)], at the actual time instant latexmath:[t], all other discrete-time variables, especially the discrete <<state,`states`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t)], can be computed. +
Discrete <<state,`states`>> are not visible in the interface of an FMU and are only introduced here to clarify the mathematical description.
Formally, a discrete <<state>> is part of the <<output,`outputs`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{y}] or the <<local>> variables latexmath:[\mathbf{w}] of an FMU.

When the transient simulation of the coupled system through Co-Simulation is completed, the sequence of evaluations is the following (here latexmath:[\mathbf{x} = {\lbrack \mathbf{x}_c; \mathbf{x}_d \rbrack}^T] is the combined vector of continuous-time and discrete-time <<state,states>>, and latexmath:[\mathbf{y} = {\lbrack \mathbf{y}_c; \mathbf{y}_d \rbrack}^T]) is the combined vector of continuous-time and discrete-time <<output,`outputs`>>):

Definition <<equation-basic-co-simulation-evaluations>> is consistent with the definition of co-simulation by <<KS00>>.

* At the communication points, the master provides generalized inputs to the slave, which can be:

** The current <<input>> variables latexmath:[\mathbf{u}_i^{(0)}] of the subsystem (in other words, the <<input>> variables of the model contained in the slave simulator, in the sense of system-level simulation), along with some of their successive <<derivative,`derivatives`>> latexmath:[\left\{ \mathbf{u}_i^{(j)} \right\}_{j=1,\cdots,m_{ido}}] (in case of continuous-time variables), where latexmath:[m_{ido}] stands for the model input derivative order.

** Varying <<parameter,`parameters`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{p}_{tune,i}], also known as <<tunable>> <<parameter,`parameters`>>.

* The slave provides generalized outputs to the master, which are:

** The current output variables latexmath:[\mathbf{y}_{i+1}^{(0)}]of the subsystem (same remark as above), along with some of their successive <<derivative,`derivatives`>> latexmath:[\left\{ \mathbf{y}_{i+1}^{(j)} \right\}_{j=1,\cdots,m_{odo}}](in case of continuous-time variables).

** Observation variables and <<calculated>> varying <<parameter,`parameters`>> latexmath:[\mathbf{w}_{i+1}], along with directional derivatives estimated at latexmath:[t = tc_{i+1}] (in case of continuous-time variables).

* Initialization: The slave being a sampled-data system, its internal states (which can be either continuous-time or discrete-time) need to be initialized at latexmath:[t = tc_0].
This is performed through an auxiliary function _[this relationship is defined in the XML file under elements `<ModelStructure><InitialUnknown>`]_:

Computing the solution of an FMI Co-Simulation model means to split the solution process in two phases and in every phase different equations and solution methods are utilized.
The phases can be categorized according to the following modes:

==== Initialization Mode
This mode is used to compute at the start time latexmath:[t_0] initial values for internal variables of the Co-Simulation slave, especially for continuous-time <<state,`states`>>, latexmath:[\mathbf{x}_d(t_0)], and for the previous discrete-time <<state,`states`>>, latexmath:[^{\bullet}\mathbf{x}_d(t_0)], by utilizing extra equations not present in the other mode _[for example, equations to set all <<derivative,`derivatives`>> to zero, that is, to initialize in steady-state]_.
If the slave is connected in loops with other models, iterations over the FMU equations are possible.
Algebraic equations are solved in this mode.

==== Step Mode
This mode is used to compute the values of all continuous-time and discrete-time variables at communication points by numerically solving ordinary differential, algebraic and discrete equations.
If the slave is connected in loops with other models, no iterations over the FMU equations are possible.

_[Note that for a Co-Simulation FMU, no super-dense time description is used at communication points.]_

The equations are defined in <<table-math-basic-co-simulation>> can be evaluated in the respective mode.
The following color coding is used in the table:

//=== Improving efficiency in multi-FMU environment when asynchronous mode is used

In the particular context of multi-FMU architectures, significant co-simulation speed-up may be obtained if the master can avoid waiting until the end of the slowest FMU step integration.
If an FMU prematurely stops its current step integration computation due to an unpredictable internal event before the normal end of the step calculation, all other concurrently running FMUs may be stopped as soon as possible in order to minimize the time needed for the Co-Simulation master to resynchronize all the FMUs at the same event time.

In this context based on parallel multi-FMU calculations, the following figure illustrates different possibilities to synchronize FMUs at the same event time.

.Different possibilities to synchronize parallel FMUs at the same event time.

[caption="Figure 12: "]
image::images/earlyReturnFigure.png[width=100%, align="center"]

Each FMU starts integration from communication point latexmath:[t_{i}] to reach the next communication point latexmath:[t_{i+1}].
Assuming an unexpected internal event is detected at latexmath:[t^{'}_{i+1}< t_{i+1}] during FMU~1~ integration, the master is informed of this early return.
So now the master would like to avoid other FMUs exceed the event time, since all FMUs should be resynchronized at the event time which will be the next new communication point.

* In the case of FMU~1~, the internal event time becomes the new latexmath:[t_{i+1}] time, i.e. this is the source of the event.
* In the case of FMU~2~, a complete rollback from latexmath:[t_{i}] to latexmath:[t^{'}_{i+1}] is necessary.
* In the case of FMU~3~, computation is immediately interrupted and only a partial rollback is necessary to reach latexmath:[t^{'}_{i+1}] time.
* In the case of FMU~4~, the current step integration has been interrupted at latexmath:[t^{'}_{i+1}] and no rollback is necessary.

Each ongoing FMU stops its integration either exactly at the broken time given by the master or immediately after its current intermediate step if this time is already out-of-date.
Afterwards, a new step integration done on the FMU returns and signals the premature stop (early-return) to the master.

Due to the early-return mechanism, the overall execution time of the simulation is reduced.
