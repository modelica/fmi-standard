=== FMI Description Schema

This is defined in <<fmi-description-schema>>.
Additionally, the Co-Simulation specific element `Implementation` is defined in the next section.

==== Co-Simulation FMU (CoSimulation) [[schema-co-simulation]]
//TODO: find better place for attribute description!
//TODO: check wording "slave"

If the XML file defines an FMU for Co-Simulation, element `CoSimulation` must be present.
It is defined as:

//TODO: update XML images
image::images/cs_xml_1.png[width=80%, align="center"]

image::images/cs_xml_2.png[width=70%, align="center"]

These attributes have the following meaning (all attributes are optional with exception of `modelIdentifier`):

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|====
|Attribute Name
|_Description_

|`modelIdentifier`
|Short class name according to C syntax, for example, "A_B_C".
Used as prefix for FMI functions if the functions are provided in C source code or in static libraries, but not if the functions are provided by a DLL/SharedObject.
`modelIdentifier` is also used as name of the static library or DLL/SharedObject.
See also <<header-files-and-naming-of-functions>>.

|`needsExecutionTool`
|If `true`, a tool is needed to execute the model.
The FMU just contains the communication to this tool (see <<figure-co-simulation-with-tool-coupling>>).
_[Typically, this information is only utilized for information purposes.
For example, a Co-Simulation master can inform the user that a tool has to be available on the computer where the slave is instantiated.
The name of the tool can be taken from attribute `generationTool` of `fmiModelDescription`.]_

|`canBeInstantiatedOnlyOncePerProcess`
|This flag indicates cases (especially for embedded code), where only one instance per FMU is possible. (For multiple instantiation the default is `false`; if multiple instances are needed, the FMUs must be instantiated in different processes.).

|`canNotUseMemoryManagementFunctions`
|If `true`, the slave uses its own functions for memory allocation and freeing only.
The callback functions <<allocateMemory>> and <<freeMemory>> given in <<fmi3Instantiate>> are ignored.

|`canGetAndSetFMUState`
|If `true`, the environment can inquire the internal FMU state and restore it.
That is, `fmi3GetFMUState`, `fmi3SetFMUState`, and `fmi3FreeFMUState` are supported by the FMU.

|`canSerializeFMUState`
|If `true`, the environment can serialize the internal FMU state, in other words, <<fmi3SerializedFMUStateSize>>, <<fmi3SerializeFMUState>>, `fmi3DeSerializeFMUState` are supported by the FMU.
If this is the case, then flag `canGetAndSetFMUState` must be `true` as well.

|`providesDirectionalDerivative`
|If `true`, the directional derivative of the equations at communication points can be computed with `fmi3GetDirectionalDerivative`.

|`canInterpolateInputs`
|The slave is able to interpolate <<continuous>> <<input,`inputs`>>.
Calling of `fmi3SetRealInputDerivatives` has an effect for the slave.

|`maxOutputDerivativeOrder`
|The slave is able to provide <<derivative,`derivatives`>> of <<output,`outputs`>> with maximum order.
Calling of `fmi3GetRealOutputDerivatives` is allowed up to the order defined by `maxOutputDerivativeOrder`.

|`canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`
|The slave can handle variable communication step size.
The communication step size (parameter communicationStepSize of <<fmi3DoStep>>) has not to be constant for each call.

|`providesIntermediateVariableAccess`
|The slave is able to provide access to selected variables during callback function call `intermediateUpdate()`.
The accessible variables are marked with attribute <<intermediateAccess>> = `true`.

|`canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate`
|If `true`, the slave is able to return early from <<fmi3DoStep>> if master calls <<fmi3DoEarlyReturn>> during callback function call `intermediateUpdate()` and `canReturnEarly = true` in `fmi3IntermediateUpdateInfo`.
_[If set to `true` and `providesHybridCoSimulation` is set to `false`, the FMU supports the basic functionality of ending DoSteps before the planned next communication point time.
This is controlled by the simulation master for avoiding unnecessary computations and roll backs of the FMU due to external events known by the simulation master]_

|`providesHybridCoSimulation`
|If `true`, the slave can be set to Co-Simulation mode `fmi3ModeHybridCoSimulation` during instantiation of FMU.
If set to `true` also `canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate` must be set to `true`.

|`providesScheduledExecutionSimulation`
|If `true`, the slave can be set to Co-Simulation mode `fmi3ModeScheduledExecutionSimulation` during instantiation of FMU.

|`canNotUseBasicCoSimulation`
|If `false`, the slave can be set to Co-Simulation mode `fmi3ModeCoSimulation` during instantiation of FMU.
_[the support of basic co-simulation should be possible for most Co-Simulation FMUs, thus the default value is `false`.]_



|====

The flags have the following default values. +
boolean: `false` +
unsignedInt: 0 +

Note that if `needsExecutionTool = true`, then it is required that the original tool is available to be executed in Co-Simulation mode.
If `needsExecutionTool = false`, the slave is completely contained inside the FMU in source code or binary format (DLL/SharedObject).

===== Example XML Description File [[xml-example-co-simulation]]

The example below is the same as shown in <<xml-example-model-exchange>> for a Model Exchange FMU.
The only difference is the replacement of the element `ModelExchange` with the element `CoSimulation` (with additional attributes) and the removal of <<local>> variables, which are associated with continuous <<state,`states`>> and their <<derivative,`derivatives`>>.
The XML file may have the following content:

[source, xml]

include::examples/co_simulation.xml[]

==== Early Return from Current Communication Step

The simulation master collects the information about the capability of an FMU to perform an early return by analyzing the `modelDescription.xml` as defined in section <<fmi-description-schema>> and <<fmi-for-co-simulation>>.


===== Co-Simulation FMU (CoSimulation)
In order to support the early return in <<fmi3DoStep>> the capability flag  `canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate` in the XML should be `true`.

===== Example XML Description File


Here is an example of an XML of an FMU supporting early return.

:INSTANTIATE: fmi3Instantiate()

==== Co-Simulation with Clock Support [[schema-clocked-co-simulation]]

The Co-Simulation master collects the information about the number and properties of <<clock,`clocks`>> supported by the FMU by analyzing the `modelDescription.xml`, see section <<clock-type-definition>>.

The definition of <<clock,`clocks`>> is optional.

Each <<inputClock>> that ticks outside of the FMU, is activated for an FMU based on their <<valueReference>>`.
<<outputClock,`Output clocks`>> inside of an FMU signal their activation based on their <<valueReference>>`.

_[If dependencies (_fmi3VariableDependency_) are defined in the `Modelstructure` section of the `modelDescription.xml`, it is recommended to define such dependencies only within a model partition of a model (i.e. between variables that are assigned to the same <<clock>>).]_

If dependencies are defined for variables across model partitions, such variables can not be assigned to a <<clock>> via <<clockReference>>.

For FMI for Co-Simulation, variables that are assigned to a model partition of the model based on <<clockReference>> are not necessarily `clocked`.
Such variables can be Continuous-time or Discrete-time variables if the <<clock>> is of `clockType = CPClock`.


===== Capability Flags [[xml-flags-clocked-co-simulation]]

If the XML file defines an FMU for Clocked Co-Simulation, element `CoSimulation` must be present as described in section <<fmi-for-co-simulation>>.

In order to provide a Clocked Co-Simulation, the attribute `providesHybridCoSimulation` has set to be set to `true`.


===== Example XML Description File [[xml-example-clocked-co-simulation]]

The example below is the same one as shown in <<xml-example-co-simulation>> for a Co-Simulation FMU.
The only differences are, that `providesHybridCoSimulation` is set to `true` and <<clock,`clocks`>> are defined in the `modelDescription.xml`. #[TODO]: Recheck later#
The XML file may have the following content:

[source, xml]
----
//include::examples/co_simulation_clocked_cosimulation.xml[]
----

==== Scheduled Execution Simulation Support [[schema-scheduled-execution-simulation]]

The simulation master collects the information about the number and properties of <<clock,`clocks`>> supported by the FMU via analyzing the `modelDescription.xml` as defined in section 2.2. and 4.3.

Each <<clock>> that ticks outside of the FMU is activated for an FMU based on its <<clockReference>>.
There is a direct one-to-one relation for a <<clock>> and a model partition.

If <<clock,`clocks`>> are defined and the flag `providesScheduledExecutionSimulation = true`, the Co-Simulation master can set the fmuType to `fmi3ScheduledExecutionSimulation`.
If no <<inputClock,`input clocks`>> are defined the flag `providesScheduledExecutionSimulation` shall not be set to `true`.

===== Example XML Description File

The example below is the same one as shown in section [TBD] for a `fmi3ClockedCoSimulation` FMU.
