=== Description Schema [[co-simulation-schema]]

The common XML elements and attributes are defined in <<fmi-description-schema>>.
Additional elements and attributes are defined subsequently.
If the FMU implements the Co-Simulation interface type, the element `<CoSimulation>` must be present.
It is defined as:

.CoSimulation element.

The attributes in the following table are defined on top of the <<common-capability-flags, common attributes>> and have the following meaning (all attributes are optional with exception of `modelIdentifier`):

|Attribute
|Description

|`modelIdentifier`
|Short class name according to C syntax, for example, `A_B_C`.
Used as prefix for FMI functions if the functions are provided in C source code or in static libraries, but not if the functions are provided by a DLL/SharedObject.
`modelIdentifier` is also used as name of the static library or DLL/SharedObject.
See also <<header-files-and-naming-of-functions>>.

|[[canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize,`canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`]]`canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize`
|The FMU can handle variable communication step size.
The communication step size (argument <<communicationStepSize>> of <<fmi3DoStep>>) has not to be constant for each call.

|<<canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate>>
|If `true`, the FMU is able to return early from <<fmi3DoStep>> if the co-simulation algorithm returns <<earlyReturnRequested,`earlyReturnRequested == fmi3True`>> from the callback <<intermediateUpdate>> and <<canReturnEarly,`canReturnEarly == fmi3True`>>.
_[If set to `true`, a Co-Simulation FMU supports ending <<fmi3DoStep>> before the planned next communication point._
_This can be used by the co-simulation algorithm to avoid unnecessary computations and roll backs of the FMU due to input clock activations known to the co-simulation algorithm.]_

|`fixedInternalStepSize`
|The fixed internal step size of the FMU (optional).
_[This information can be used by the co-simulation algorithm to synchronize the communication interval with the internal step size of the FMU._
_The co-simulation algorithm should calculate the communication points by multiplying (`number_of_steps * step_size`) instead of repeatedly incrementing (`time += step_size`) to avoid the accumulation of numerical errors.]_

|`hasEventMode`
|If `true` the FMU supports *Event Mode*.
Even if this flag is `true`, the co-simulation algorithm can chose to delegate event handling to the FMU by calling <<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> with `eventModeUsed == fmi3False`.
If `eventModeUsed == fmi3True`, the co-simulation algorithm will have to actively trigger event handling in the FMU using <<fmi3EnterEventMode>>.
<<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> must only be called with `eventModeUsed == fmi3True` if `hasEventMode == true`.
If the FMU has synchronous clocks, then `eventModeUsed == fmi3True` and the importer must call <<fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation>> with `eventModeUsed == fmi3True`.
|====

Note that if `needsExecutionTool = true`, then it is required that the original tool is available to be executed during co-simulation.
If `needsExecutionTool = false`, the FMU is completely contained inside the FMU in source code or binary format (DLL/SharedObject).

==== Clocks in Co-Simulation [[clocks-in-co-simulation]]

The co-simulation algorithm collects the information about the number and properties of <<clock,`clocks`>> supported by the FMU by analyzing the <<modelDescription.xml>>, see <<clock-type-definition>>.

The definition of <<clock,`clocks`>> is optional.

Each <<inputClock>> that ticks outside of the FMU, is activated for an FMU based on their <<valueReference>>.
<<outputClock,`Output clocks`>> inside of an FMU signal their activation based on their <<valueReference>>.

_[If <<dependencies>> (`fmi3Unknown`) are defined in the `<ModelStructure>` section of the <<modelDescription.xml>>, it is recommended to define such <<dependencies>> only within a model partition of a model (i.e. between variables that are assigned to the same <<clock>>).]_

If <<dependencies>> are defined for variables across model partitions, such variables can not be assigned to a <<clock>> via <<clockReference>>.

For FMI for Co-Simulation, variables that are assigned to a model partition of the model based on <<clockReference>> are not necessarily `clocked`.

==== Example XML Description File

===== Example XML Description File with Early Return [[xml-example-co-simulation]]

The <<xml-example-fmimodeldescription-cosimulation>> below is the same as shown in <<xml-example-model-exchange>> for a Model Exchange FMU.
The only differences are the replacement of the element `<ModelExchange>` with the element `<CoSimulation>` (with additional attributes),  and the removal of <<local>> variables, which are associated with continuous <<state,`states`>> and their <<derivative,`derivatives`>> and presence of the capability flags <<canHandleVariableCommunicationStepSize>> and <<canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate>> with value `true`.

===== Example XML Description File with Clocks [[xml-example-clocked-co-simulation]]

// TODO: Add example and rewrite paragraph

The example below is the same one as shown in <<xml-example-co-simulation>> for a Co-Simulation FMU.
The only differences are, that the element `<fmiModelDescription><CoSimulation>` is present and <<clock,`clocks`>> are defined in the <<modelDescription.xml>>.
The XML file may have the following content:
