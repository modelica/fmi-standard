# The Modelica Association Project (MAP) Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("CCLA")

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with respect to Contributions, as further defined, from any person or entity, the Modelica Association Project FMI (the "Project") must have a Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.
This license is for your protection as a contributor as well as for the protection of the FMI Project, and for the Modelica Association as publisher of the FMI standard and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

This CCLA allows an entity (the "Corporation") to submit Contributions to the FMI Project, to authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees to the Project, and to grant copyright and patent licenses thereto.
